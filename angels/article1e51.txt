WASHINGTON -- The Angels have made their living this year with strong starting pitching to keep games close and Francisco Rodriguez to shut teams down. The latter's 31 saves put him miles ahead of the rest of the league in that category. 

But manager Mike Scioscia said that while they don't get the same recognition, the contributions of middle relievers like Scot Shields and Jose Arredondo are just as crucial to his team's success this season.

"Francisco's not going to get all those opportunities without the job that Scot Shields is doing and Arredondo is doing or Darren Oliver," Scioscia said. "That's very important."



The Angels bullpen has struggled at times this year, with a 4.14 ERA to show for it -- good for 10th in the American League. However, individual statistics tell a different story, particularly of late.

Shields might be the poster child of that upswing. The veteran right-hander hasn't allowed a run in his last 13 outings -- 14 innings total -- and his ERA is a cool 2.35.

Arredondo has been perhaps even better this season, currently leading the bullpen staff with a 1.76 ERA. He's struck out 12 in 15 1/3 innings, while walking just two over that time. Additionally, 13 of the rookie reliever's 15 outings have been scoreless.

Before Tuesday's game, Scioscia said the key for his entire staff this year has been the balance it has gained from having solid starting pitching, dependable relief work and a lights-out closer like Rodriguez. 

The Los Angeles manager added that he thinks the bullpen's stability this season has been helped by consistently solid performances from the pitching staff.

"What's helped our bullpen to keep their roles is the length and very, very good innings that our starters are getting," Scioscia said. "All that stuff that happens before Francisco is very important."
