The Arkansas Travelers have had an up-and-down season, winning a taut first-half pennant race before plummeting to last place in the second. 

But through it all, the steady production and quiet leadership of Ben Johnson has been a near-constant.

Johnson, the Angels' 23rd-round Draft pick in 2004, has had a breakthrough season. Despite spending a month with Triple-A Salt Lake, the 26-year-old hit 20 homers and drove in 77 runs for the Travelers while logging time at catcher, first base, right field, left field and designated hitter.

Johnson and his teammates are now attempting to erase the sour memories of the season's 26-44 second half as they head into a best-of-5 North Division playoff series against the upstart Northwest Arkansas Naturals.

"There has been a lot of player movement after the first half ended," said Johnson. "We lost [left fielder] Coby Smith, [catcher] Tim Duff has been up and down, I was gone for a month and a couple of guys got hurt. So right now, it feels like we're putting the team back together. We have to reestablish our chemistry and try to get things rolling again."

Things were really rolling for the Travelers on June 17, when they defeated the Springfield Cardinals, 7-6, in a one-game playoff for the first-half North Division title. The Travelers scored a run in the eighth inning and a run in the ninth to tie the game at 4-4. The Cardinals answered with two runs in the top of the 11th to take a 6-4 lead, but Arkansas rallied for three in bottom of the frame to win the division. 

Adam Greenberg capped the improbable comeback with a two-run single to right field.

"Without a doubt, that was one of the most exciting games I've ever been a part of," Johnson said.

If the Travelers are able to recapture their first-half magic, it's likely that Johnson will be a primary contributor. In addition to being a key part of the offense, the Seattle native brings even more value to the club with his defensive versatility.

"It's all about having a good plan and being prepared," he said. "A big thing for me this year has been having the chance to play every day. I don't have to worry about whether I'm in the lineup or not, like I have in the past. Basically, I'll do whatever I can in order to get myself into a ballgame."

The Travelers are returning to the playoffs for the first time since 2005, when they lost to Midland in the championship series. The franchise has won six Texas League titles since joining the circuit in 1966. The Naturals, meanwhile, are aiming to make their inaugural season an especially memorable one. The club relocated to Northwest Arkansas upon the conclusion of the 2007 campaign after 21 seasons as the Wichita Wranglers. The franchise last appeared in the playoffs in 2006, when the Wranglers were defeated in the finals by the Corpus Christi Hooks.

Head-to-Head

These new intrastate rivals played a staggering 32 times during the season, and the Naturals emerged with an 18-14 advantage. The clubs split their first 28 games, but Northwest Arkansas swept a four-game series in late August as they made a furious charge for the second-half North Division title.

3B Corey Smith played 31 games against the Naturals, slugging a team-high seven homers and drove in 16 runs in 120 at-bats. LF Brian Stavisky got on base at a .477 clip and slugged .551 over 20 games. Right-handers Robert Mosebach and Fernando Rodriguez each notched three wins against the Naturals while compiling ERAs of 2.24 and 2.57, respectively. RHP Dan Denham went 1-3 despite a 1.52 ERA over 29 2/3 innings. ... 1B Juan Richardson smacked a team-high five home runs and 22 RBIs against the Travelers, while veteran DH Cory Aldridge compiled a 1.110 OPS over 10 games. Twelve different Natural pitchers notched at least one win against Arkansas this season. Reliever Kyle Crist led the way as the 25-year-old compiled a 3-0 record and 2.49 ERA over eight appearances. LHP Rowdy Hardy went 1-4 with a 5.98 ERA over a team-high 43 2/3 innings.

Players to Watch

Arkansas: Corey Smith's 26 home runs are tied for the most in the league with Northwest Arkansas' Kila Ka'aihue. Stavisky hit .312 and drove in 51 runs over 86 ballgames while getting on base at a .408 clip. ... Mosebach (9-12, 4.62 ERA) and Denham (9-10, 4.44 ERA) finished 1-2 on the club in innings pitched. Closer Rafael Rodriguez compiled an 0.55 ERA over 16 1/3 innings in August, converting seven of eight save opportunities.

Northwest Arkansas: In addition to Aldridge and Richardson, CF Jose Duarte, 3B Mario Lisson and RF Brian McFall all reached double digits in home runs. Even more impressive is the amount of speed the Naturals have in the lineup. LF Ovandy Suero leads the club with 42 steals, while Lisson has 31 and Duarte has 28. ... RHP Daniel Cortes has emerged as the staff ace. The 21-year-old right-hander is 10-4 with a 3.78 ERA over 23 starts. RHP Chris Hayes has converted 12 saves in as many opportunities. He went 5-2 with a 1.64 ERA in 40 appearances.

The RoughRiders played their inaugural season in 2003 and won a league championship in 2004. Last season, Frisco was knocked out of the playoffs in the first round by San Antonio, which is aiming to repeat as Texas League champions. The Missions, in fact, have won four titles since 1997. Frisco is in the playoffs after winning the South in both the first and second half. San Antonio was awarded the division's other postseason berth, by virtue of having the next-best overall record.

Head-to-Head

Frisco dominated the season series, 21-11. The RoughRiders really had the Missions' number during the season's first half, winning the first seven meetings and nine of the first 10. 

1B Chad Tracy hit well in limited action against the Missions, compiling a .421 average and 1.082 OPS over 19 at-bats. LF Steven Murphy played in 31 games vs. San Antonio and led the RoughRiders with seven homers and 24 RBIs. RHP Neftali Feliz didn't allow a run over three starts, totaling 11 1/3 innings. Likewise, RHP J.B. Diaz did not allow a run over five appearances, spanning 8 2/3 frames. ... 1B Kyle Blanks drove in a team-high 21 runs over 31 games while going deep three times. CF Drew Macias got on base at a .440 clip against Frisco, largely thanks to drawing 31 walks in 31 games. RHP Matthew Buschmann went 1-4 over seven starts, despite compiling a 2.75 ERA over 39 1/3 innings. RHP Greg Burke went 1-2 with four saves over 14 appearances (one start), spanning 21 1/3 innings.

Players to Watch

Frisco: SS Elvis Andrus is a serious threat on the basepaths. The 20-year-old Venezuelan stole 53 bases in 69 opportunities. RF Dustin Majewski's .402 on-base percentage ranks fifth in the Texas League, while Murphy leads the club in home runs (20) and RBIs (87). ... Despite a pedestrian 4.04 ERA, RHP Brandon Puffer has compiled a 7-0 record over 38 relief appearances. The only current RoughRider with more wins than Puffer is right-hander Trey Hodges, who went 8-8 with a 5.76 ERA and ended the season in the bullpen. He was replaced by southpaw Zack Parker, who has gone 2-0 with a 3.50 ERA over nine starts.

San Antonio: Blanks finished second in the league in RBIs with 107, while his .325 average ranked third. Macias hit .288 and leads all current Missions in runs (92), hits (145), walks (83) and stolen bases (18). SS Jesus Lopez has hit .356 since receiving a promotion from Class A Advanced Lake Elsinore in mid-August. ... RHP Michael Ekstrom led the team with 11 victories, despite the fact that only 15 of his 41 appearances were starts. Buschmann tossed a team-leading 148 innings and went 10-6 with a sparkling 2.98 ERA. Burke went 2-7 with a 2.24 ERA and 23 saves, although his ERA after the All-Star break was a mediocre 4.20.
