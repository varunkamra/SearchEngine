LOS ANGELES -- The Angels' recent cycle of opponents is a small case of feast and famine.

After dispatching the Dodgers on Sunday, the Halos ran their record to 37-28 against their regional rival, but Tuesday they will open a three-game series in Toronto, where their run has edged the opposite direction.

Since 1996, the Angels are 18-38 at Rogers Centre, and the Blue Jays have won eight of the last season series between the two clubs, including each of the last five.

But manager Mike Scioscia is quick to point out that he never looks at an opponent, and instead to his own club to assess his chances.

In Tuesday's series opener, Scioscia will hand the ball to John Lackey, who will be making his second start after returning from the disabled list with a strained right triceps. Lackey was sharp in his season debut, allowing a run over seven innings for a no-decision.

Scioscia said the right-hander progressed through his normal routine without a hitch.

"He feels great in between [starts], and that is important for his season, especially if he is able to throw as well as he did the other day," Scioscia said.

Lackey said his fastball wasn't as sharp as he'd like against the White Sox, but his curveball was effective. He allowed six hits, walked one and struck out four, and Scioscia was impressed.

"His fastball command was good, but when John is on, he has uncanny fastball command," Scioscia said. "His game is built on establishing that fastball command, and then he spins the ball as well as anyone in our league. So when he gets that breaking ball, he's tough. He was fine."




Pitching matchup
LAA: RHP John Lackey (0-0, 1.29 ERA)
The right-hander's last outing was his first start this season, and after a shaky first couple of batters, Lackey settled in. Three straight hits to open the game produced a run, but a double play and a strikeout got Lackey out of the jam. From there, he cruised and appeared to show no signs of the right triceps strain that held him out until mid-May. Lackey is 2-2 in his career at Rogers Centre.


TOR: RHP Dustin McGowan (2-3, 4.38) 
McGowan takes the place of Roy Halladay, who tossed 2 1/3 innings of relief on Sunday against the Phillies in a game delayed two hours, 43 minutes by rain. McGowan has been inconsistent, looking good one start and dubious the next. He had his roughest start of the season in his last outing, getting touched by the Indians for nine runs in 3 2/3 innings in a 12-0 loss on May 10. 


Tidbits
Howie Kendrick and Chone Figgins both are on the disabled list, but each will accompany the team on the upcoming road trip to Toronto and Chicago. Scioscia said Kendrick has stopped running as he tries to recover from a left hamstring strain, and he will be re-evaluated by team orthopedist Dr. Lewis Yocum. Figgins is doing agility drills, but has yet to run the bases. Return dates for either player have not been set. ... Maicer Izturis went 3-for-5 on Sunday, and has seven hits and five runs scored in his last 17 at-bats. ... Casey Kotchman went 3-for-3 on Sunday, his 13th multi-hit game of the year, and drove in his team-leading 26th run.
