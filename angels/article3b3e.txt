PHILADELPHIA -- The best young lefty in the National League awaits scorching-hot Vladimir Guerrero and his Angels on Sunday. Cole Hamels will bring the heat, accompanied by a big breaking ball, changeup and superb command.

It will be interesting to see if Hamels brings any of his stuff into the strike zone to Guerrero, who has turned Citizens Bank Park into his private playground for two nights, belting three home runs.

The Angels counter with Jered Weaver, who has the ability to be among the best young right-handers in the American League. He has put together some dominant performances, but inconsistency is preventing Weaver from taking his place among the elite.





"Jered's been throwing the ball well," Angels manager Mike Scioscia said. "He can't be locked in every time out."

True, but it would be a good idea this time out, against Hamels. The only southpaw in his league at the moment is the Mets' Johan Santana, and a case can be made that Hamels, all things considered, has been better than even the great Santana this season.

Hamels is third in the league in innings (106), tied for fourth in strikeouts (91), third in opponent's batting average (.208) and 10th in ERA (3.23). Most remarkable is his 2.73 ERA at home, in the cozy confines of South Philly.

Hamels has remarkable command of the strike zone for a young pitcher -- especially a young southpaw. He has yielded only 29 walks, four of those intentional.

Weaver's control has been comparable: 24 walks (two intentional) across 91 1/3 innings, against 65 strikeouts. Chase Utley, who sat out Saturday night's game in an 0-for-23 slump, will be back at second base for the Phillies. It's the longest hitless stretch of his career.

"They have a lot of weapons over there," Scioscia said. "That's a very productive offense."

Torii Hunter, rested on Saturday with Gary Matthews Jr. in center field, will be back in center on Sunday. Matthews is likely to spell Garret Anderson in left against Hamels. Mike Napoli, who hasn't played in the past six games, is expected to catch Weaver, with Jeff Mathis getting a day off.

Scioscia said he has been going with the hot hand, Mathis having delivered both offensively and defensively of late, while Napoli has been in a 2-for-36 slide.

"Jeff's been catching great baseball, bringing great game plans in," Scioscia said. "He's having great results. At the plate, he's picking it up, too. He's just earned more playing time. We're going to need them both, no doubt about it."

Erick Aybar is expected to be at shortstop after Maicer Izturis left Saturday night's game in the third inning, having aggravated a right hamstring strain.


Pitching matchup
LAA: RHP Jered Weaver (6-7, 4.73 ERA)
Weaver's roller-coaster ride continues. Coming off one of his finest efforts against the Rays, he was pounded by the Mets for six earned runs on eight hits, including a pair of Carlos Beltran homers, across 6 1/3 innings on Monday night. Weaver had appeared to find his rhythm with three scoreless innings when he yielded a pair of hits and departed, both runners scoring. He's facing the Phillies for the first time.

PHI: LHP Cole Hamels (7-4, 3.23 ERA)
Hamels held the Red Sox to two runs in seven innings on Monday. His seventh win of the season put him into a tie for the Phillies' team lead. Hamels has now posted three consecutive quality starts, and the Phils are 10-5 when he takes the hill. Hamels' matchup against the Angels will mark his second consecutive start against a team he has never faced.


Tidbits
One of Weaver's big challenges will be controlling the Phillies' running game, which has been just as productive as the Angels' from a statistical standpoint. They don't run quite as aggressively as the Angels, but the Phils have a higher success rate on steals -- 88.5 percent compared to 71.7 percent by the Angels through Friday. ... After holding the Phillies to two hits in seven innings Friday night, Ervin Santana is now the third-hardest pitcher in the AL to hit, with a .222 opponent's average. He's also fifth in strikeouts (91) and Ks per nine innings (8.0). ... Francisco Rodriguez is on pace for 62 saves, which would eclipse the single-season record of 57 set by Bobby Thigpen of the White Sox in 1990. K-Rod's club-record streak of 25 successful saves was snapped by the Mets on Wednesday night in Anaheim. ... Eight of the Angels' 11 pitchers and 16 of their 25 players are products of the farm system.
