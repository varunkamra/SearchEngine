ANAHEIM -- On the big league roster or not, Maicer Izturis created enough buzz to win the organization's top rookie honor this spring.

On Friday, Izturis took home the Fred Haney Memorial Award after hitting .339 and posting a .456 on-base percentage in 21 Cactus League games. The slick-fielding shortstop also had 14 RBIs, second only to Casey Kotchman this spring.

"From Day 1 since spring practice began, he has been lights out," manager Mike Scioscia said. "The way he attacks ground balls and the way he looks at the plate, he is every bit the player he was billed."

The Angels acquired Izturis in November along with outfielder/designated hitter Juan Rivera from the Nationals in exchange for Jose Guillen and it's a deal that is paying dividends. Rivera provides right-handed bench power and Izturis adds infield depth as the No. 2 shortstop behind  Orlando Cabrera.

"Izturis is an impressive player because he has the ability to play a premium position at short," said Scioscia, who added he was more impressed by Izturis' team-leading 11 walks this spring than other stats. "He can also play third and second."

Izturis' spot on the Angels' Opening Day roster appears secure. Not only has he been impressive in camp, but with Dallas McPherson opening the season in the minors two spots are still open. Along with Izturis, Kotchman and Lou Merloni are under consideration, as is outfielder Curtis Pride.

Merloni also holds an edge, at least in the current scheme that is the 2005 roster. The Angels are not in dire need of another outfielder and Merloni can play more positions than Kotchman, who would benefit from the rhythm of playing every day.

Izturis wants to play with the Angels, but knows his only choice is to show them what he can do on the field.

"I would prefer to be in the big leagues," Izturis said with Jose Molina serving as his interpreter. "You don't just get experience by playing (in the Majors), you get experience by sitting on the bench and learning."

Cesar Izturis, Maicer's half-brother, was on the field as the starting shortstop for the Dodgers in Game 1 of the Freeway Series on Friday. Maicer Izturis said he has an invitation to live with his brother in the event he makes the Angels, but has his bags packed for any destination.

Loose ends: The Angels have a decision to make with Merloni that extends beyond simple playing time. The club is hoping the veteran will sign an agreement that will allow them to reduce the amount owed him if he is sent to the minors this season.

Merloni will be owed about $500,000 if he is on the Opening Day roster, but the Angels might release him if he does not sign the agreement. While he's not thrilled about a pay cut, he's less interested in being unable to sign with another team if he's locked into a deal and spends the season in Triple-A so he is continuing to discuss the matter with the club.

"All of this could be for naught," Merloni said. "Hopefully we can get it straightened out."


On the shelf: Cabrera will be held out of action for the remaining two games on the exhibition schedule with a bruised right hand, Scioscia said.



The shortstop has been bothered by the bruise on the palm of his throwing hand at the base of his middle finger for about a week and a half, but is expected to be ready for Opening Day.



Morales update: Kendry Morales is playing, just not for the Angels. The Cuban defector is playing at the team's training facility in the Dominican Republic, Scioscia said.



Morales is trying to make the switch from first base to third and once he clears the legal hurdles to enter the United States, he could end up just about anywhere in the Angels organization, outside of the Major League level.



"He's a talented kid. We have to size him up and see where he is," Scioscia said. "He could start anywhere (in the minor league system). He just needs to play."




What's in a name? Whichever side prevails in the dispute involving his club's new name, Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, isn't weighing heavily on Scioscia. The only name he is truly concerned in linking with Angels is "champs."

"It has no effect on what we need to do," Scioscia said. "It has no effect on what we need to do on the field."

As for the marketing war over which team plays "L.A." style of ball, Scioscia could care even less.

"All I care about is the way the Angels are playing baseball," Scioscia said. "We're going to play our style of baseball and our game."

Inflated numbers: Vladimir Guerrero's batting average hovered near the Mendoza Line most of the spring before he left the desert with a .270 mark, while Kotchman was hot all spring. But it's the numbers during the regular season that propel teams to October.

"I think spring stats are just that; they are spring stats," Scioscia said. "We're not going to judge things on that."

On deck: The Angels will travel north on Interstate 5 for Game 2 of the Freeway Series with the Dodgers on Saturday. Right-hander John Lackey will face right-hander Jeff Weaver at Dodger Stadium at 7:10 p.m. PT.
