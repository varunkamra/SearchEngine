ANAHEIM -- Angels right-hander Jered Weaver has had plenty of time to reflect on his strange stat line from his start against the Dodgers on Saturday.

Six innings pitched, no hits, one earned run, three walks, six strikeouts, and yet, one loss. 

Weaver and reliever Jose Arredondo combined to no-hit the Dodgers for eight innings but had nothing to show for it, as two errors in the fifth inning -- one by Weaver -- led to the Dodgers' lone run in the Angels' 1-0 loss.

"It is what it is," Weaver said. "You don't get to see those games very often. It was definitely a weird game, but a loss is a loss. What are you going to do? You have to take them the same way."

Even though Weaver took the loss, it was his second straight solid start after getting roughed up by the Mets by the tune of six runs in 6 1/3 innings on June 16. Weaver has allowed just one earned run and four hits in his last 11 1/3 innings while striking out 12 hitters.

Weaver will look to continue that trend when the Angels host the Blue Jays and starter A.J. Burnett on Friday in the first game of a three-game series.

"I've thrown the ball well the last couple starts, so I'll try to build off that and take it into the game on Friday," Weaver said.

Weaver was battered by the Blue Jays in his lone start against them this season, on May 30, as he allowed six earned runs on 10 hits in just four innings, which was his second shortest start of the season. Since that start, however, Weaver has pitched at least six innings in four of his last five outings.

Even though the Blue Jays' run total is the fourth lowest in the American League, Weaver said it's important to be wary of Toronto's offense.

"They have some guys who can do some damage," Weaver said. "It's about pitching them the right way and keeping them off balance."



Pitching matchup
LAA: RHP Jered Weaver (7-8, 4.30 ERA)
It's not every day you pitch six no-hit innings and have to explain a loss afterward, but that was Weaver's plight on Saturday night at Dodger Stadium. His inability to handle a quirky dribbler cost him an error and the only run of the game, marring an otherwise marvelous effort. Weaver struck out six and walked three, and he wasn't happy about the free passes. But his fastball had life and his breaking stuff was in the strike zone consistently enough to handcuff Dodgers hitters. Weaver is 2-1 in three lifetime starts against the Blue Jays, that one loss coming on May 30 at Angel Stadium, where he surrendered six earned runs on 10 hits in four innings.


TOR: RHP A.J. Burnett (8-7, 4.74 ERA)
Against the Braves in his last start, Burnett struck out a season-high 11 batters. He allowed no runs on four hits over seven innings for the win. He walked four and needed a season-high 119 pitches to complete the outing. Sporting a much better curveball of late, the hard-throwing Jays right-hander has gone 2-0 with a 0.60 ERA in his last two starts. In his three career starts against the Angels, he is 1-1 with a 3.43 ERA.
