Angels right-hander Bartolo Colon, who missed most of last season with a tear in his rotator cuff, made a successful return to the mound on Thursday night.



Pitching for high Class A Rancho Cucamonga in a California League game against Lake Elsinore, Colon gave up one hit and a walk in four scoreless innings, striking out five.



Facing 15 batters, Colon threw 61 pitches and left with Rancho Cucamonga leading, 1-0. Lake Elsinore is affiliated with the San Diego Padres.


Colon is scheduled for three or four rehab starts in his recovery from the shoulder injury that limited the 2005 American League Cy Young Award winner to 10 starts last season. He could be back in the Angels' rotation by April 20.


Jered Weaver, a sensation as a rookie for the Angels last season, is slated to make his first rehab start from biceps tendinitis on Friday night for Rancho Cucamonga against Lake Elsinore.



Weaver is shooting for an April 16 return to the rotation when the Angels are in Boston.
