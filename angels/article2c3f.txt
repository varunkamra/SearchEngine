ANAHEIM -- On catcher Bobby Wilson's first day in the big leagues, he didn't have to look very far to find a familiar face.

Wilson was a high school teammate with first baseman Casey Kotchman. The two graduated together in 2001. Prior to that, Wilson and Kotchman had played every level together from Little League all the way up.

"It was a unique situation," Wilson said. "Casey and I played in high school together, so we've known each other forever."

Kotchman wasn't surprised that Wilson arrived in Anaheim.

"It was just a matter of time before he got here," Kotchman said. "We were both hoping it would be sooner rather than later, but it's nice to see him here."

Wilson's father, Bob, is a baseball coach at St. Petersburg Junior College. Bobby Wilson said that team is going to the state tournament this year, but that his father is coming to see him in Anaheim this week. He learned of his promotion at about midnight Monday and made his first call to his father.

Wilson signed out of St. Petersburg Junior College in 2003, but did not play for his father there. At Triple-A Salt Lake this season, Wilson was hitting .339 [21-for-62] with six doubles and 12 RBIs in 16 games. The Angels have always spoken highly of Wilson's catching skills in the Minor Leagues.

Kotchman and Wilson graduated from Seminole High School in Florida in 2001, where they finished the season ranked No. 1 in the nation and had six players drafted. Kotchman signed with the Angels as a first-round pick that year. Wilson was not drafted out of high school. He was a 48th-round pick after his first year of junior college baseball in 2002. He
signed after the 2003 junior college season and played for Casey's father, Tom, in rookie ball. Tom Kotchman is also the scout who signed Wilson.

Pitcher Scot Shields had a warm welcome for Wilson. Shields was also signed by Tom Kotchman.

"It's just great to finally be here," Wilson said.
