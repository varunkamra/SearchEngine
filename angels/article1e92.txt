ANAHEIM -- The Angels sit all alone at the top of the Major League Baseball standings with the best record, yet manager Mike Scioscia said he doesn't pay any attention to where his team sits in the standings.



"Records are neither here nor there right now," Scioscia said. "We have to focus on our club, and there's some things we need to do better -- and we're starting to see some signs of it."



Scioscia then compared a team's record to a student's grade, saying that nothing matters until the end of a school year -- or, in the Angels'
case, the end of the season.



"A report card is our standings or our record, but we don't want to look at that until our finals, which comes at the end of the season," Scioscia said.



Scioscia's philosophy of not letting his team's record get to his head carries down to his players, who also don't put much stock into their place in the standings.



"We don't think like that," first baseman Casey Kotchman said. "We just try and to show up each and every day, and try to work hard and win games."



Second baseman Howie Kendrick admitted that having the best record "feels good," but then he quickly went back to toeing the company line.



"There's a lot of baseball left, and anything can happen -- no matter how big your lead is," Kendrick said. "It's a crazy game, so we just have to continue to keep playing good baseball."



The Angels have a chance to add to their Major League best record when they host the Indians in the second game of a three game series Tuesday night. Right-hander Jered Weaver will face Indians right-hander Matt Ginter.



Weaver has been on a run recently, as he has allowed two earned runs or fewer in each of his last four starts. But he has struggled against the Indians in his career, as he carries a 5.08 ERA in four starts against Cleveland.



However, Weaver hasn't faced the Indians this season, and Cleveland's offense isn't as good as in years past. But while the Tribe has the second-worst batting average in the American League and has scored the sixth fewest runs in the league, it's has won seven of its last eight games. 

 Pitching matchup
LAA: RHP Jered Weaver (8-8, 4.03 ERA)
Weaver continued his recent run of solid outings by throwing six strong innings against the Rangers on July 9. He allowed just one earned run on seven hits, but the Angels lost the game on Josh Hamilton's game-winning home run in the ninth inning off Angels closer Francisco Rodriguez. Weaver has allowed two earned runs or fewer in each of his last four starts.


CLE: RHP Matt Ginter (1-0, 0.00 ERA)
In his first Major League start since 2005, Ginter gave the Indians more than they could have expected in a pinch. The 30-year-old righty tossed five scoreless innings and rarely sniffed trouble in his first Major League win in four years. He struck out five and walked none, while only using an efficient 65 pitches. Ginter has struggled against the Angels, compiling a 8.72 ERA in one start and eight relief appearances.

Tidbits
Angels right-hander Kelvim Escobar will have season-ending shoulder surgery on July 29 in New York. Escobar decided to have surgery on his torn labrum July 12, but the date of the surgery wasn't announced until Monday. Mets orthopedist David Altchek will perform the surgery. ... Angels catcher Mike Napoli began a throwing program Monday in his recovery from an inflamed right shoulder that has put him on the disabled list, retroactive to June 6. He threw a few times Sunday to get warmed up, but the program began Monday. Scioscia said there remains no timetable for Napoli's return. ... Chad Reed, who won the American Motorcycle Association Supercross title and an FIM World Championship this year, will throw out the first pitch on Tuesday.
