A month ago, the race in the American League West seemed to be a runaway with the Angels in command.

But the white-hot A's have made it a race.

Rookie Ervin Santana will take the hill for the Angels in the second game of the three-game series on Wednesday night. The young right-hander faced the A's on July 18 at Angel Stadium and allowed two runs on four hits and three walks over seven innings to pick up the win.

Santana is 3-1 with a 2.49 ERA in his last four starts.

Left-hander Barry Zito will start for Oakland. Zito is riding an eight-game winning streak.
