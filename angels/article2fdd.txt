WASHINGTON -- If close games are really like close shaves, the Angels should be smooth as can be.

After Monday night's 3-2 victory, Los Angeles had a 32-13 record in games decided by two runs or fewer. At 47-30 overall, the Angels' winning percentage -- .610 -- is a full .100 less than their .711 mark in games normally too close for comfort.





Center fielder Torii Hunter credited the team's stellar pitching and steady defense for keeping the Angels in ballgames even when their offense is struggling to score. Hunter added that the team's desire gives them a mental edge late in games.

"It's all about who wants it more, and I think we want it more," Hunter said. "That's probably the reason. That's the only reason I can come up with."

Hunter said he and his teammates have prevailed in so many tight contests this year that they never feel like they're out of a ballgame. According to Hunter, the club has enough faith in its pitching and hitting to believe it has a good shot at picking up the win every night.

Chone Figgins agreed with Hunter's explanation for Los Angeles' propensity to succeed in heart-racing moments. Figgins admitted he and his teammates would like to score more runs -- they ranked 11th in the American League in runs headed into Monday's action -- but he said doing everything else well has kept the team headed in the right direction.

"You'd like to be winning by more," Figgins said. "We're still playing good defense and we're pitching and we're getting timely hitting, and I think most teams like to have things like that going for them."

Though there's plenty of baseball left to play, Hunter admitted that, if the Angels make the playoffs, their experience in winning tight games will be invaluable.

"All playoff games, usually 80 percent of them are close," Hunter said. "They never get out of hand, so anybody's got a chance to win."

Pitcher John Lackey said the team doesn't put much stock in the manner in which they win, only that they come through somehow.

"We're about winning here, man. Who cares what it looks like?" Lackey said. "We don't really care what the score is."

The close games are certainly helping closer Francisco Rodriguez, who leads the Majors with 31 saves and is on pace to break Bobby Thigpen's single-season record of 57.

"It's good for the closer, isn't it?" Lackey asked, laughing. "It kind of worked out that way, he's racking them up."


Pitching matchup
LAA: RHP Jon Garland (6-4, 4.06 ERA)
After a shaky start, Garland settled down and kept the Angels in the game last Wednesday against the Mets, holding them to three runs (two earned) in six innings. The big right-hander has settled into a nice groove of late, getting early-count outs and pitching with a nice tempo by keeping his fastball in the strike zone. Garland, with the White Sox, faced the Nationals franchise twice, going 0-1 with a 3.00 ERA.

WSH: RHP Shawn Hill (1-4, 5.22 ERA)
Hill struggled in his last start in Minnesota, lasting just 3 2/3 innings. He gave up seven runs -- six earned -- on 10 hits while striking out two. Hill's problem wasn't throwing strikes, as 53 of his 78 pitches found the strike zone.
