ST. PETERSBURG -- Garret Anderson and Casey Kotchman were out of Wednesday's lineup, due as much to Rays starter Scott Kazmir holding lefties to .205 hitting against him as it was a timely break.
Artificial turf is hard on any player, and especially so for Anderson, the 35-year-old outfielder. With a three-game series at the Metrodome coming immediately after the Angels leave Tampa Bay, Angels manager Mike Scioscia thought it was wise to give Anderson a rest before sticking him in the field for Thursday's morning game.
Here's the question: Anderson is the Angels all-time leader in games played (1,805), hits (2,131), doubles (445), total bases (3,370) and RBIs (1,143). He ranks second in home runs. Who is in first?
Rotation, rotation: The Angels plan to recall southpaw Joe Saunders from Triple-A Salt Lake to start in place of Santana on Sunday at Minnesota. Saunders has seen two tours with the club already this season, including a three-start stint in April, and two outings in June. The 26-year-old is 3-0 with a 2.97 ERA this season for the Halos, and 10-3, 4.49 in his Major League career (20 starts).
"He's been working on some stuff," Scioscia said, in reference to Saunders' less-than-spectacular 4-7 record and 5.11 ERA stats at Triple-A. "We're got a lot of confidence in what he can bring."
Saunders is expected to join the team either on Friday or Saturday, in Minnesota. A roster move will be made accordingly, and since Mike Napoli's activation leaves the team with three catchers, it'll likely be a catcher who's sent down.
Down on the farm: Salt Lake allowed 19 hits and seven runs in the sixth inning alone during a 12-6 loss to Tacoma. ... Third baseman Freddy Sandoval had the game-winning three-run homer in the top of the 10th in Double-A Arkansas' 9-6 win over Wichita. ... Led by shortstop Hainley Statia's 4-for-5 night, Class A Rancho Cucamonga scored five in the eighth inning and won 8-1 over Inland Empire. ... Class A Cedar Rapids allowed 11 runs on 10 hits in the fourth inning and went on to lose 11-4 to Dayton.
On this date in Angels history: In 1994, J.T. Snow hits his first career grand slam, against Red Sox pitcher Tim Van Egmond in the first inning.

And the answer is: Anderson's 243 career homers with the Angels is 56 shy of Tim Salmon, who played with the Angels from 1997-2006.
Up next: The Angels enjoy a day game on Thursday at Tropicana Field before hitting the road to face Minnesota for a three-game set. Right-hander Kelvim Escobar (10-3, 3.04 ERA) will get the ball for the Halos, and he'll do battle against righty Andy Sonnanstine (1-4, 5.57). First pitch is scheduled for 9:10 a.m. PT.
