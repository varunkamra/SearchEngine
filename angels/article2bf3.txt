A mere 17 games remain on the season, and the Angels are clinging to a one-game lead over the A's in the American League West.

On Thursday, the Halos will open their last homestand of the regular season, a stretch of 10 games featuring Detroit, Texas and Tampa Bay.

Bartolo Colon will start the opener against the Tigers, hoping to win his 20th game and become the first Angels pitcher to do so since Nolan Ryan in 1974. The right-hander has suffered from a sore lower back, but was able to make his last start. Colon allowed two runs over six innings for a win against the White Sox. In two starts against the Tigers this season, Colon has allowed four runs over 14 innings and took a complete-game loss against Detroit at home on May 7.

Right-handers John Lackey, Ervin Santana and Paul Byrd will follow Colon in the rotation.

Starting for Detroit on Thursday will be left-hander Mike Maroth. Right-handers Jason Johnson and Roman Colon and left-hander Nate Robertson are scheduled to start in the series.
