The Angels have won just two of their last nine games, but they will be gunning for a modest two-game winning streak on Sunday.

Kelvim Escobar was sharp over 6 2/3 scoreless innings on Saturday, and John Lackey will be looking to continue the string.

Lackey allowed four runs to take the loss in his last start and was ejected for his involvement in a bases-clearing fracas in the sixth inning. Lackey threw a breaking ball to Jason Kendall that did not hit the A's catcher, but the two exchanged words, and Kendall charged the mound.

Of greater concern for Lackey, though, is a recent tendency to walk batters. He has 14 in his last three starts. Lackey faced the Blue Jays once last season and pitched eight shutout innings. He is 2-1 against them in his career.

After a recent string of subpar offensive performances, the Angels got a bit of a lift on Saturday when Tim Salmon's homer got things started.

"We didn't do a great job -- we did a good job on the offensive side," manager Mike Scioscia said. "But we won today with the guys on the mound, and we have to keep doing that."

Right-hander Casey Janssen will make his third Major League start.


Pitching matchup
LAA: RHP John Lackey (3-2, 3.62 ERA)

TOR: RHP Casey Janssen (0-2, 6.30 ERA)
