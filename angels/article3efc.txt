Making a big impression with his game-changing, little-ball skills, Angels outfielder Reggie Willits finished fifth in the 2007 American League's Jackie Robinson Rookie of the Year race.

Boston's Dustin Pedroia claimed the award in balloting announced on Monday by the Baseball Writers Association of America.

Willits received two second-place votes and five third-place ballots for 11 points, one behind Boston's Daisuke Matsuzaka.

Pedroia, the dynamic Red Sox second baseman who excelled in the postseason, was the runaway winner, receiving 24 of 28 first-place votes. Three first-place votes went to Delmon Young of Tampa Bay and one to Kansas City's Brian Bannister.

Willits, a fourth outfielder coming into the season, proved highly valuable for the American League West Division champion Angels.

Filling in capably for injured Garret Anderson early in the season, Willits, 26, batted .345 in April, .330 in May and .342 in June before wearing down and sustaining nagging injuries in the second half.

Willits played all three outfield positions, becoming a popular figure with fans for his all-out, aggressive style of play.

A native of Chickasha, Okla., taken in the seventh round of the 2003 First-Year Player Draft out of the University of Oklahoma, Willits batted .293 overall with a .391 on-base percentage -- franchise records for rookies in both categories.


Willits scored 74 runs in 136 games, primarily batting leadoff and ninth, and was second on the club with 27 steals. The Angels were 42-19 when he scored at least one run.

A disciplined hitter who worked counts as well as anyone in manager Mike Scioscia's lineup, Willits averaged 4.4 pitches per at-bat, the highest figure in the AL. He also was fourth in the league with 11 sacrifice bunts.

Tim Salmon is the only Angels player to have won the AL Rookie of the Year Award. The outfielder was the 1993 winner.
