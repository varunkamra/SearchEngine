In the afterglow of a regular season for the ages came another painfully abrupt postseason, four games and out at the hands of Boston in the American League Division Series. Now comes an offseason that might be characterized as question-marked.

Rarely have the Angels, AL champions four of the past five seasons, entered a winter with so many personnel issues to resolve and so many problems to solve.

Two of the most coveted potential free agents in the marketplace helped drive the Angels to their Major League-leading, franchise-best 100-win season. Francisco Rodriguez is poised to take his all-time record 62 saves into free agency, and slugging first baseman Mark Teixeira -- acquired from Atlanta on July 29 at the cost of Casey Kotchman and prospect Steve Marek -- is expected to join K-Rod on the list of prized free agents.

Also likely to be made available to the highest bidder are Garret Anderson, the most productive offensive player in Angels history, starter Jon Garland, outfielder Juan Rivera and valued middle reliever Darren Oliver.

The Angels hold club options on Vladimir Guerrero and John Lackey, as with Anderson. Guerrero ($15.5 million) and Lackey ($7.3 million) are expected to be renewed, but Anderson's $12.6 million almost certainly will not be picked up. The club can buy him out for $3 million, the same number for Guerrero. Lackey's buyout is $500,000.

While they've made it clear they would like to bring back Teixeira and K-Rod, it remains to be seen if the duo can be fit into the club's projected $125 million budget. Owner Arte Moreno has made it clear he doesn't plan to exceed by significant measure the club's $119.2 million payroll entering the 2007 season.

The Angels have five players eligible for arbitration -- Chone Figgins, Maicer Izturis, Mike Napoli, Robb Quinlan and Ervin Santana. They figure to command raises, with significant hikes due Figgins, Izturis, Napoli and Santana. Quinlan, a .285 career hitter, could be non-tendered in light of the extraordinary depth the Angels have at the corner positions.

Their uncommon depth throughout the roster will serve as a safety net should several of those big-name stars end up elsewhere. Young players knocking on the door for regular jobs include infielders Brandon Wood, Sean Rodriguez, Kendry Morales, Matt Brown and Freddy Sandoval; outfielders Reggie Willits and Morales, catcher Bobby Wilson, starting pitchers Nick Adenhart, Nick Green and Anthony Ortega and relievers Darren O'Day, Kevin Jepsen and Jason Bulger.

Not bringing back Anderson ($12.6 million), Garland ($12 million), K-Rod ($10 million), Rivera ($2.025 million) and Oliver ($2 million) along with Kotchman's detached $1.45 million would trim the 2007 payroll by $37.075 million, deducting Anderson's $3 million buyout.

That should be enough for the club to actively pursue Teixeira -- believed to be their No. 1 target -- and perhaps CC Sabathia, the premier starter on the market.

Another possibility would be to explore deals for proven talent, shopping coveted prospects with appealing salaries.

Most prominent potential replacements for K-Rod are setup man Scot Shields and emerging star Jose Arredondo. Kelvim Escobar, sidelined for the entire 2007 season with shoulder surgery, could be back around mid-season either in his former starting role or as a late-inning reliever, a role he has filled both in Toronto and in Anaheim.

CATCHERS

Mike Napoli, .273 BA, 20 HRs, 49 RBIs
Jeff Mathis, .194 BA, 9 HRs, 42 RBIs
Bobby Wilson, .312 BA, 4 HRs, 45 RBIs (Triple-A)

Napoli had the highest HRs to ABs ratio in the AL (20 in 227 ABs) and is ready for a breakout season if he can stay healthy. The staff loves throwing to Mathis, who needs more consistency with the bat. Wilson is a solid across the board.

FIRST BASE

Kendry Morales, .213 BA, 3 HRs, 8 RBIs
Robb Quinlan, .262 BA, 1 HR, 11 RBIs
Matt Brown, .053,  0 HRs, 3 RBIs

If Teixeira departs, it's back to the drawing board, with Morales getting first shot after impressive cameos. Brown, primarily a third baseman, excelled for Team USA in the Beijing Olympics.

SECOND BASE

Howie Kendrick, .306 BA, 3 HRs, 37 RBIs
Sean Rodriguez, .204 BA, 3 HRs, 10 RBIs

Kendrick needs a healthy full season, free of hamstring and hand ailments, to show how good he can be. Rodriguez brings excellent defense, versatility and surprising power.

SHORTSTOP

Maicer Izturis, .269 BA, .329 OBP, 11 steals
Erick Aybar, .277 BA, .314 OBP, 7 steals
Brandon Wood, .200 BA, 5 homers, 13 RBIs

Izturis is sure-handed and steady, with a bat that produces in clutch situations. Aybar is more spectacular defensively with big upside. Wood brings light-tower power and gets it done defensively here and at third base.

THIRD BASE

Chone Figgins, .276 BA, .367 OBP, 34 steals
Wood, .296, 31 HRs, 84 RBIs (Triple-A)
Quinlan
Brown, 320 BA, 21 HRs, 67 RBIs (Triple-A)

Figgins has emerged as a front-line third baseman defensively and remains invaluable as a catalyst, but he also is a wild card for the club, capable of handling at least four other positions if parts are moved. Wood has the power teams love at this position.

OUTFIELD

Torii Hunter, .278 BA, 21 HRs, 78 RBIs
Vladimir Guerrero, .303 BA, 27 HRs, 97 RBIs
Garret Anderson, .293 BA, 15 HRs, 84 RBIs
Gary Matthews Jr., .242 BA, 8 HRs, 46 RBIs
Reggie Willits, .194 BA, .321 OBP, 2 SBs
Morales, .341 BA, 15 HRs,  64 RBIs (Triple-A)


Guerrero could need knee surgery this winter to return to full-time duty in right field rather than dividing his time between right and designated hitter. If Anderson goes to free agency and doesn't return, left field is up for grabs.

ROTATION

John Lackey (12-5,  3.75 ERA, 130 Ks)
Ervin Santana, 16-7, 3.49 ERA, 214 Ks
Joe Saunders, 17-7, 3.41 ERA, 103 Ks
Jered Weaver, 11-10, 4.33 ERA, 152 Ks
Kelvim Escobar (did not pitch in 2008)
Dustin Moseley, 2-4, 6.79 ERA
Shane Loux, 12-6, 3.98 (Triple-A)

There's a chance Jon Garland, a free agent, will return. Co-ace in 2007 with Lackey, Escobar (shoulder surgery) could reclaim his spot around midseason.

BULLPEN

Scot Shields, 6-4, 2.70 ERA, 4 SVs, 64 Ks
Jose Arredondo, 10-2, 1.62 ERA, 55 Ks
Justin Speier, 2-8, 5.03 ERA 56 Ks
Kevin Jepsen, 0-1, 4.32 ERA; 3-4, 1.81 ERA, 13 SVs (Double-A, Triple-A)
Darren O'Day, 0-1, 4.57 ERA; 2-2,  3.27 ERA, 7 SVs (Triple-A)
Jason Bulger, 0-0, 7.31 ERA; 4-0, 0.63 ERA, 16 SVs (Triple-A)
Rich Thompson, 0-0, 22.50; 1-0, 4.05 (Triple-A)

There is depth here, but it remains to be seen if there's enough to absorb the loss of the game's premier saves artist, K-Rod, and dependable Darren Oliver.
