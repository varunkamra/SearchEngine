The Angels can clinch a series win over the Rangers on Tuesday when they meet for the second game of a three-game set. The odds are in the Angels' favor, as Halo starter Bartolo Colon is 13-5 in his career against the Rangers.

Colon pitched a complete game in his last start, allowing only one run. It was the second complete-game loss for Colon this year, but the Angels' ace hasn't had any trouble earning wins against the Rangers. He's riding an eight-game winning streak against the Rangers and was 6-0 against them in 2004 with a 2.14 ERA.

Chan Ho Park will start for the Rangers. Park, 31, has won more games (seven) in 13 starts this season than he did in 23 starts over the last two seasons (five). The right-hander is 4-6 with a 5.29 ERA in his career against the Angels.

Paul Byrd (7-5) pitched his first complete game since 2002 Monday and Vladimir Guerrero drove in four runs as the Angels beat the Rangers in the series opener, 5-1.
