All-Star right-hander Ervin Santana is among five Angels who filed for arbitration on Thursday. He was joined by Darren Oliver, Robb Quinlan, Maicer Izturis and Mike Napoli.

Figures will be exchanged by the club and players on Jan. 20, with hearings running between Feb. 1-21.

Rebounding from a dismal 2007, Santana was among the Majors' dominant starters, going 16-7 with a 3.49 ERA while striking out 214 hitters in 219 innings. Santana, who earned $420,000 in 2008, figures to command a significant raise after becoming an All-Star for the first time. At 26, he has three years and 104 days of Major League service time.

Oliver, 38, is coming off two excellent seasons in middle relief. A Type A free agent, he accepted the Angels offer of arbitration rather than become a free agent. Oliver, who made $2 million in 2008, was 7-1 with a 2.88 ERA in 54 appearances, working 72 innings. He has 13 years and 127 days of service time.

Quinlan, 31, with five years and 40 days of service time, will be eligible for free agency next offseason if he isn't signed to an extension. Quinlan earned $1.05 million in 2008. The corner infielder and outfielder batted .262 with one homer and 11 RBIs in 164 at-bats. He's a .285 career hitter whose value increased when the Angels were unable to sign Mark Teixeira.

Izturis, 28, opened 2008 as the Angels' starting shortstop, but his season ended with a torn ligament in his left thumb on Aug. 13, requiring surgery. He batted .269, close to his .272 lifetime average, with three homers and 37 RBIs in 290 at-bats. The versatile infielder, who earned $1.2 million, has four years and 38 days of service time.




Napoli, who made $425,000 in 2008, overcame shoulder trouble to finish with a bang, producing 20 homers and 49 RBIs in 227 at-bats while batting .273. The 27-year-old catcher had two homers and scored the decisive run after singling in the Angels' lone victory in the American League Division Series in Boston. He has two years, 151 days of service time.







The Angels had one arbitration case go to a hearing last spring, prevailing when closer Francisco Rodriguez, now with the Mets, was awarded $10 million. K-Rod went on to deliver a record-breaking 62 saves for the AL West champions.
