TORONTO -- Erick Aybar, making his 39th consecutive start at shortstop for the Angels, left Tuesday night's game in the bottom of the first inning after injuring his right hand making a play behind second base.

Aybar was diagnosed with a dislocated pinky finger. X-rays were negative. He will visit a hand specialist on Wednesday.

Aybar ranged far to his left and made a diving stab of a grounder by Alex Rios. He appeared to bang his hand on the carpeted surface before trying to make a throw from his back. The ball arrived too late to get the out at first, and Aybar came up writhing in pain.

Robb Quinlan came in to play third, with Maicer Izturis moving over to shortstop.

Aybar has been a rock of stability in an infield unhinged over the past month by injuries to Howard Kendrick (left hamstring), Chone Figgins (right hamstring) and Izturis (back spasms).

Izturis, the Opening Day shortstop, is back and has been playing second base, primarily, while also filling in at third. Figgins, the regular third baseman, could be back on Wednesday.

Aybar, batting .270 and second in the Majors in infield hits with 13, has been a familiar sight on highlight shows with his spectacular plays.
