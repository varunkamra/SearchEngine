ANAHEIM -- The Angels made two separate moves Thursday to make room for Nick Adenhart by putting Maicer Izturis on the 15-day disabled list and sending Kelvim Escobar to the 60-day DL.

Adenhart made his Major League debut Thursday night against the A's, and placing Izturis on the DL opened a spot on the 25-man roster while transferring Escobar form the 15-day to the 60-day, created an opening on the 40-man.

Izturis suffered a lower back strain Sunday in Detroit as he ran the bases from first to second. An MRI revealed no damage, but the infielder said he still has some inflammation in the area and feels pain when he swings a bat or takes ground balls.

"When you play things are going to happen," said Izturis, who will be eligible to come off May 12 when the Angels open a homestand with a three-game series against the White Sox. "It is better to get a little rest, then I'll be ready to play."

Izturis is hitting .192 in 22 games this season and filled in at second base for the injured Howie Kendrick, who is expected to return this weekend from a left hamstring strain. This is the fourth straight season that Izturis has made at least one trip to the DL and the club is being deliberate with the 27-year-old.

"He is really just sore in a pretty diffused area in his back. It is hard to pinpoint right now. You want to get this thing behind him," manager Mike Scioscia said. "We're going to need the DL to get him back to 100 percent."

Escobar opened the season on the DL with a torn right labrum and the concern is the injury could be career-threatening. The right-hander has re-started his throwing regimen after a setback in Spring Training. If he experiences more pain he will likely have surgery, but Scioscia said he's taken a positive step.

"He feels great," Scioscia said. "Not that he's actually throwing his splitty and slider yet, but he feels much different than when he started to throw a month ago and that's very encouraging."
