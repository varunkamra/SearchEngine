The Angels have won two games in a row to assume a 2 1/2-game lead in the American League West, and they'll try to make it three in a row when left-hander Jarrod Washburn takes the ball against Kris Benson and the New York Mets on Saturday night.

Washburn is coming off two straight no-decisions in games in which he logged quality starts. He gave up three earned runs in six innings in both outings, the last one coming in a game the Angels eventually lost to the Boston Red Sox in Fenway Park on June 5.

Saturday's game will be a tough assignment for the Angels if Benson's performance against the club last year is any indication. Benson, then pitching for the Pittsburgh Pirates, beat the Angels by throwing eight innings and giving up two runs -- one earned -- on five hits while striking out eight.
