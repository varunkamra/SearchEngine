ANAHEIM -- Shortly after Nick Adenhart earned his first Major League victory on Monday, the Angels optioned the 21-year-old right-hander to Triple-A Salt Lake and recalled right-handed reliever Jose Arredondo.

Adenhart was sent down because John Lackey will come off the disabled list and make his season debut Wednesday against the White Sox.

Arredondo, 24, has long been one of the prized power relief arms in the Angels organization. At Salt Lake this season, he is 1-1 with a 2.12 ERA, 10 saves, and 15 strikeouts in 17 innings.

Adenhart earned his first Major League victory Monday, going 5 2/3 innings and allowing four runs and nine hits in a 10-7 win over the White Sox. Adenhart (1-0) improved in each of his three starts and lowered his ERA to 9.00.

"His stuff plays here," Angels manager Mike Scioscia said. "It was good for him to get some experience here."
