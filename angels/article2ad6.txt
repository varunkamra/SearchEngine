PEORIA, Ariz. -- One week into his life with the Angels, Torii Hunter has made a distinct impression on Mike Scioscia. In some respects, the center fielder calls to mind Dusty Baker, a glowing performer and leader from the Angels manager's youth with the Dodgers.

"Torii's personality is fun to be around," Scioscia said on a gray Sunday morning at Tempe Diablo Stadium. "He's really a light -- just a good person, good with all his teammates. He's been around, knows the game.

"I think his personality will certainly be a positive in the clubhouse. The guys can rally around him. There's an energy there -- not that there wasn't before. O.C. [Orlando Cabrera] had that energy in the clubhouse. [Darin] Erstad brought an energy."

Baker, a three-time National League Manager of the Year with the Giants embarking on a new odyssey with the Reds, brought a blend of toughness and compassion to the Dodgers' clubhouse when Scioscia was finding his way as a young catcher. Scioscia's description of Hunter -- and Baker -- could serve as a definition of presence.

"With Bake, there were certain times of the day when you saw his game face on -- it was time to be on that field helping his team win," Scioscia said. "Dusty was certainly a uniting force in that clubhouse. Dusty was always a common denominator, a sounding board. He was terrific in the clubhouse.

"I haven't been around Torii that long, but there's an energy he brings, and you can't miss it. You walk into that morning meeting, you know where Torii is. He's there."

Leadership, Scioscia was quick to point out, comes in a variety of forms. His early Angels clubs had fiery, vocal focal points such as Troy Percival, Erstad and Adam Kennedy. Garret Anderson always has carried a different kind of clubhouse presence -- cool, confident, somewhat detached -- but has left a clear impact nonetheless in Scioscia's view.

"Garret's more subtle," Scioscia said. "Garret might be the most misread person from the standpoint of the media and fans. His internal mechanism that he has to compete and win is as strong as anyone I've been around in the game."

That is why it never surprises Scioscia to hear that the designated hitter role has little appeal to Anderson -- or Vladimir Guerrero, for that matter. These are elite athletes, driven to play the total game. They want to earn their money with five tools, not one or two.

 How many runs, not how: Scioscia tends to dismiss talk that his team doesn't generate enough home runs to compete with the upper crust of American League offenses, pointing out that the Angels were fourth in the league in runs scored in a 2007 season disrupted by frequent injuries to key personnel.

"Home runs are nice, slugging percentage is important -- but the bottom line is how many runs you score," Scioscia said. "I think we have the ability to drive the ball more this year [having added Hunter's 28 home runs]. Running the bases will still be a strength, but we might not have the same need for situational hitting we've had before."


 Power ball: Scioscia's optimism for increased thunder has been buoyed by his first foursome in batting practice. Hunter, Anderson, Guerrero and Gary Matthews Jr. have been putting on an impressive display in the early going.

It's within reason that the quartet could combine for 100 home runs. They produced 89 in 2007, with Anderson missing most of the first half and Matthews sidelined much of the second half with injuries.

Scioscia also expects increased power output from Casey Kotchman, Howard Kendrick and Mike Napoli, each of whom was rendered inactive for periods with injuries and ailments.


 Hit and miss: Scioscia wasn't overly impressed -- or surprised -- when some Bill James numbers were hurled his way regarding Guerrero. Guerrero apparently looked at a total of 139 called strikes all season while swinging at 616 pitches out of the strike zone.

"The strike zone's a relative term," Scioscia said. "Guys like Manny Sanguillen, Roberto Clemente, Yogi [Berra] ... maybe a pitch wasn't in the strike zone, but they squared it up.

"Vlad's got incredible range [in the hitting zone]. When he can reach a ball, he can drive it."

Range, indeed. Dodgers right-hander Brad Penny, a Marlins pitcher at the time, hasn't forgotten how Guerrero, then with the Expos, went down for a pitch that had bounced in the dirt in Florida -- and lifted it over the fence.


 Dynamic duo: Don Baylor and Tim Salmon are set to bring their wisdom and expertise to camp as guest instructors on Tuesday, remaining through Saturday.

Baylor was the first Angels player to claim an American League Most Valuable Player Award as a driving force for the 1979 AL champions. Salmon, who holds many of the club's offensive records that Anderson hasn't claimed, was a leader of the 2002 World Series championship outfit.

Game time: Prior to Thursday's Cactus League opener against the Rangers in Tempe, the Angels will stage a five-inning intrasquad game on Wednesday.
