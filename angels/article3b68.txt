MESA, Ariz. -- Strength in numbers. That capsulizes the Angels' position with respect to their starting rotation as Opening Day approaches, eight days away and counting.

Manager Mike Scioscia has eight names in place for the five slots. He seems confident that eight will go into five comfortably, even if he's unsure which eight will comprise the initial five.

Jered Weaver and Bartolo Colon will be on the outside looking in when John Lackey takes the ball the night of April 2 and goes after Texas in Anaheim. Weaver (biceps tendinitis) is pointing toward an April 16 return, with Colon (rotator cuff tear) probably arriving several weeks later.

The picture has been complicated somewhat by the uncertainty surrounding Kelvim Escobar, who tweaked his back trying to field a ground ball Saturday in Tempe.

Slotted into the second spot in the rotation, with an April 3 date with Texas, Escobar said he anticipated being ready for the Rangers after Dr. Lewis Yocum, club medical director, cleared his back.

Scioscia is holding off judgment until Escobar -- who's 1-0 with a 3.27 ERA in 11 spring innings -- delivers 90 to 100 pitches in a camp game Thursday.

The big club will be in Los Angeles that night for the first of three Freeway Series games against the Dodgers.

Hector Carrasco, the rubber-armed long reliever, will start the first game against the Dodgers, followed by Ervin Santana (Friday night in Los Angeles) and Joe Saunders (Saturday night in Anaheim).

Carrasco, invaluable to Scioscia because of his durability and willing nature, and young Dustin Moseley are the candidates to fill the No. 5 spot in the rotation until Weaver returns. That turn comes up April 6 against Oakland in Anaheim.

Moseley, who made two starts and three appearances for the Angels last summer, is a 6-foot-4, 215-pound Texan who came from Cincinnati in the winter before the 2005 season in exchange for pitcher Ramon Ortiz. He'll pitch Tuesday -- the White Sox are in Tempe that day -- while Weaver (45 pitches) and Colon (30 pitches) are working in camp games.

"We'll see how Mose comes out on Tuesday," Scioscia said. "It's between him and Carrasco. We'll have both of them ready on the sixth."

Moseley (1-0, 1.98 ERA in 13 2/3 innings) and Carrasco (1-0, 2.03 ERA in 13 1/3 innings) have had terrific springs. So has right-hander Chris Bootcheck, who appears to have a leg up in the competition for the final middle relief spot.

Bootcheck, a first-round pick in 2000, has made three Major League starts and 16 appearances with the Angels. He's 1-1 with a 3.60 ERA in 15 spring innings, striking out 10 and walking six.

Saunders, who flourished in the rotation last year, overcame tightness in his forearm to throw freely and comfortably in his most recent start. The southpaw is in fine form for his start April 5 against Oakland.

Santana, determined at 24 to improve on a 16-8 breakout season in 2006, is raring to go for his debut April 4 against Texas.

After a bout with the flu got him a little behind early in camp, Lackey came out firing and will make his final spring tuneup in a camp game Wednesday. The plan is to have him go at least six innings and throw between 90 and 100 pitches.

Making the second Opening Day start of his career, Lackey was having a flawless spring until getting knocked around by the Padres in his most recent start, inflating his ERA to a deceptive 5.51.

Of more significance -- testimony to his superb command all spring -- are his 17 strikeouts and three walks in 16 1/3 Cactus League innings.

Lackey, a 6-foot-6 Texan with presence, has the fearless manner of an ace in the Lone Star State tradition of Nolan Ryan and Roger Clemens.

Second to 2006 Cy Young Award winner Johan Santana in quality starts with 23 last year, Lackey said this spring that he thinks he has the ability to challenge for a Cy Young Award.

"I think he has terrific attributes," Scioscia said. "John can get the strikeout when he needs it. He has endurance. He's an incredible competitor.

"John has the ability to lead and be a lead dog. When Bart was in that role, he was lead dog. We need five guys out there like a five-part machine. John's held up his end time in and time out."

Lackey, 28, tied Santana in lowest slugging percentage allowed -- .360 -- among American League pitchers with at least 162 innings.

Lackey also was second to the Yankees' Chien-Ming Wang in fewest homers allowed per nine innings (0.58) and fourth in hits allowed per nine innings (8.39). He was eighth in strikeouts per nine innings (7.86).

Poised for his 150th career start, Lackey has won 41 games over the past three seasons. He's 60-49 with a 4.01 career ERA after going 13-11 last year with a 3.56 ERA in a career-high 217 2/3 innings.
