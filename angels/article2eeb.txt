ARLINGTON -- Mark Teixeira spent four full seasons with the Rangers from 2003-06, and he never finished in better than third place in the American League West.

Acquired last summer to put the Braves over the top, he still finished in third place in the National League East.

In less than two month's worth of games with the Angels, though, he's already notched his first division championship. Now, just over a week since the Angels clinched the division, he's back where his career started, letting it all sink in.

"It's great knowing we're going to the playoffs," Teixeira said. "Personal and individual accomplishments don't matter. It's all about the team and making the playoffs to play for a World Series."

Teixeira made his first return to Rangers Ballpark in Arlington on June 17, when he still was with the Braves.

At the time, he figured the three-game visit would be his last to Arlington this season, and he certainly didn't expect to return as a division champion.

"No, I thought it would probably be my last trip home," said Teixeira, who lives in nearby Westlake, Texas.

While Teixeira and the Angels have nothing to gain in the AL West standings during their series against the Rangers, they have plenty of players to regain in their lineup.

While Chone Figgins and Howie Kendrick may be a few days away, Vladimir Guerrero and Juan Rivera are expected to return to the lineup at some point this weekend.

With the way Halos manager Mike Scioscia has rotated players in and out of the designated hitter spot, he should be able to utilize it to get either Guerrero or Rivera at-bats if they aren't quite ready to play the field.

The Angels' designated hitter situation began with some controversy this season, but Scioscia has been pleased with how it's worked out.

"There's nobody who was going to be happy there 162 games," Scioscia said. "These guys have taken turns and found value in it."

Pitching matchup
LAA: RHP Dustin Moseley (2-4, 7.36 ERA)
Moseley is expected to start on Saturday, as the Angels begin to set up their rotation for the postseason, giving Ervin Santana two extra days of rest. Moseley salvaged what had been a disappointing season with an excellent performance against the Yankees in the Angels' Sept. 10 AL West title-clinching victory at Angel Stadium. Enduring a rocky first inning, he shut down the Bronx Bombers into the sixth, yielding two earned runs on three hits and three walks while striking out six. Moseley is 0-1 with a 5.49 ERA in eight career appearances against the Rangers.

TEX: RHP Vicente Padilla (13-7, 4.75 ERA)
Padilla's victory in his last start, on Sept. 9, was his first since July 25. The former came against the Mariners, and the latter came against the Athletics. Other than a victory on July 20 against the Twins, Padilla hasn't beaten a team over .500 since earning a victory against the Rays on May 27. He will have the opportunity to reverse that trend on Saturday against the first-place Angels. Padilla beat the Angels in his only start against them, on April 6, allowing four runs -- three earned -- on nine hits while striking out four.

Tidbits
Friday was the 46-year anniversary of the day Jim Fregosi hit the Angels' first inside-the-park home run in franchise history. The milestone homer came in a 9-4 victory for the Angels over the Orioles on Sept. 19, 1962.
