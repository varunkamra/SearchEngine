PADRES 8, ANGELS 7 (10 innings) 
at Peoria, Ariz. 
Tuesday, March 20

Padres at the plate: Brian Giles drilled two doubles, and his brother Marcus had two singles. Do-everything utilityman Geoff Blum had a two-run homer in the second inning and added a two-run double in the sixth. Terrmel Sledge added a two-run homer, his fifth of the spring, in the sixth. Manny Alexander knocked in the game-winning run in the 10th inning with a single to right field.

Angels at the plate: Gary Matthews Jr. slugged his third home run of the spring on a 2-0 pitch in the second inning. Chone Figgins added a solo home run in the fifth inning. Garret Anderson had two hits, as did Casey Kotchman.

Padres on the mound: San Diego staked starter Chris Young to a 3-0 lead, but the 6-foot-10 right-hander allowed the home run to Matthews and later an RBI sac fly to Howie Kendrick. All told, Young allowed four runs over five innings, with four strikeouts. Trevor Hoffman allowed a run in his fifth consecutive appearance. Scott Strickland fared considerably better, striking out the side in the eighth inning. Newcomer Justin Germano got the victory by tossing a scoreless 10th inning.

Angels on the mound: Starter Ervin Santana suffered his worst outing this spring, allowing six earned runs on nine hits over 5 1/3 innings. He allowed two home runs (Blum and Sledge). Justin Speier was impressive in his two-inning stint, allowing one hit in two scoreless innings. Scot Shields was tagged with the loss, walking two and allowing two hits.
