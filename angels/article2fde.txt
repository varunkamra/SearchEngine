ANAHEIM -- Outfielder Reggie Willits was eligible to come off the 15-day disabled list on Sunday, but Angels manager Mike Scioscia instead decided to recall right-hander Jason Bulger from Triple-A Salt Lake late Saturday night.



Scioscia made the decision because the Angels have been forced to use their bullpen more than they would like, especially after Shane Loux pitched three innings on Friday and Darren Oliver threw 2 2/3 innings on Saturday.



Bulger, who was 4-0 with a 0.66 ERA in 35 games with the Bees, gives the Angels more depth in their bullpen, even if it's just temporarily.



"We need that extra arm for coverage to let these guys reset," Scioscia said.



Willits was in the Angels' clubhouse Sunday and planned to work out during the game. He played in four Minor League rehab games with Class A Rancho Cucamonga, batting .357 with two walks and two stolen bases.



He's expected to officially rejoin the team in the next few days after he is evaluated by team doctors one more time. Willits suffered two concussions in a one week span and was placed on the disabled list on Aug. 8.



"He feels good and I'm sure we'll get him back in the next day or two, but right now we're looking to let some of our pitching reset for a day or two," Scioscia said. "He's played a lot in his rehab so we can let him recharge a little bit."



First baseman Kendry Morales was optioned to Salt Lake to make room for Bulger.
