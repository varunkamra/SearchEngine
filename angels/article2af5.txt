TEMPE, Ariz. -- The Angels used only six starting pitchers in 2004, won their division, and gave up the second-fewest runs in the American League.

But take a look through the newspapers, preseason magazines and online rankings, and the Angels are rarely mentioned as having one of the better starting rotations in baseball, let alone the AL.

There's a reason for that.

Last year, the Angels' No. 1 pitcher, Bartolo Colon, finished with the best record on the team, an 18-12 mark, but he had a 5.01 ERA, which was the result of a difficult first half in which ankle and lower back problems hindered his mechanics.

In fact, as late as early July, Colon was the worst full-time starting pitcher in baseball, with a 5-8 record and a 6.57 ERA.

Left-hander Jarrod Washburn's ERA was in the 5.00 range early in the year as well, but the Angels' offense came alive in his starts with an average of close to 10 runs per game through the first two months of the season.

Washburn missed six weeks because of a chest muscle injury and finished with a 4.64 ERA, the highest of his career as a full-time starter.

No. 4 starter John Lackey had a brutal first two months before honing his changeup and rallying down the stretch. He won a career-high 14 games, but also lost a team-high 13 and posted a 4.67 ERA.

Kelvim Escobar was the most consistent pitcher on the team all year but got no run support, which explained his 11-12 record despite a team-low 3.93 ERA.

Ramon Ortiz and Aaron Sele battled for the No. 5 spot in the rotation all season but neither proved to be consistently effective all year.

So what do the Angels do to get off to a better start with their starters?

"I wish I had the answer," Washburn said. "I've always been a slow starter. But I think there were reasons behind each guy doing how we did at the beginning of last year, so you just try to move on and improve."

Pitching coach Bud Black said he will address the issue when he gets together with the starting five in a few days. Black added that he expects good things from newcomer Paul Byrd, who was signed to a one-year deal when Sele departed via free agency and Ortiz was traded to Cincinnati.

"If Paul pitches like he's capable of pitching, and we think he will, it'll add consistency every fifth day that we haven't really had," Black said.

Byrd's moxie and pitching instincts could have a galvanizing effect on the staff.

Byrd doesn't throw particularly hard, maybe 91 on a good day, but he's had success -- a 17-win season with Kansas City in 2002 -- when he's been healthy, and he's healthy again after missing all of 2003 because of Tommy John elbow surgery.

"I solidify the staff a little bit," Byrd said. "I bring a little piece of 'you know what you're getting' into the mix. Guys watch me throw and think, 'Maybe I don't have to throw 95 mph to get hitters out.'"

Byrd also throws a lot of strikes, works quickly, and gets deep into games without throwing a lot of pitches. That's something the Angels want a lot more of.

"With the exception of Kelvim, most guys didn't have the length we wanted early on," Scioscia said of his 2004 staff. "You're not going to get five guys pitching into the eighth inning all year, but you'd like to see more of it than we had."

Scioscia said a big key to this year's pitching staff could be the improved defense of the club. The team added Gold Glove players in center fielder Steve Finley and shortstop Orlando Cabrera.

"We feel very confident in the range we have," Scioscia said. "That's going to theoretically lead to more plays being made."

And as far as Lackey's concerned, the Angels' starters still haven't reached the peak of their abilities.

"There's so much potential here," the right-hander said. "We have guys with a lot of talent. It's a matter of things lining up the way they should. I think we'll be fine."
