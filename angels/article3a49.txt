TEMPE, Ariz. -- Dallas McPherson was back in Angels camp on Thursday with the singular focus to make it back onto the field.

The third baseman is out two-to-four weeks with a herniated disc in his lower back. After an MRI indicated the bulge, McPherson was examined in Los Angeles on Wednesday at the St. Vincent's Spine Center by back specialist Robert Watkins, who administered an epidural.

McPherson will continue to take anti-inflammatory medication, and he will begin a course of therapy that includes an exercise regimen, which he said he'll take a tick more seriously.

"I learned my lesson from 2003, and keep from making a three-week injury into a two-month injury," McPherson said of his previous experience when he ruptured a disc in his lower back, but was not completely diligent in staying with his exercises after he began to feel better.

Up next for McPherson is a couple of days off before beginning any activity. He said he'll start with jogging and light weight lifting while also stretching and getting soft tissue massage. One problem is his hips, which McPherson said are tight and exert added pressure on his spine, so he'll also work on gaining flexibility there.

McPherson feels he is already ahead of the game, though, given that his condition is not as severe as it was two years ago when he fully recovered. The positive prognosis and his own experience have given him confidence he'll be return soon.

"It is a relief to know exactly what it is," McPherson said. "It is a relief to know there is no need for surgery. Now we can get to work."

Work brings on a couple of key questions, with the answers to when and how much still uncertain.

McPherson has appeared in just one Cactus League game, and he has a walk, stolen base and a run to his credit. If he can return in two weeks, McPherson can appear in as many as 12 games, which he feels should be enough to get him ready for Opening Day, barring any setbacks.

"If I can get in the last 12 games or so," McPherson said, "getting my time at the plate will be the biggest thing."

Safety first: Darin Erstad has returned to wearing a brace on his right knee, as much for his own peace of mind as anything else.

Erstad's knee is predisposed to hyperextension, and the brace puts about a 30 percent block on the joint, which helps to prevent it from extending past normal range, the first baseman said. The result is it helps protect the hamstring from injury, something that has plagued Erstad in the past.

Over the first few games of the Cactus League schedule, Erstad had gone without the brace, but he feared he may be inviting disaster without it.

"I don't feel that over the course of the season it is going to hold up," Erstad said. "It is pretty unstable."

Erstad said he is not aware of the brace when he has it on, and it helps primarily when he's in the field, especially holding runners on first and then shuffling off the bag when the pitch goes home.

"I don't want to think about it," Erstad said. "I need to concentrate on the pitch. In baseball, if you're thinking about anything else, you're lost."

Erstad is currently feeling no pain in his knee joint or in the hamstring, but he said the brace adds a comfort zone by taking a precaution to stay healthy.

"If I'm going to blow [the hamstring] out, I want to blow it out with [the brace] on. I don't want to blow it out without it," Erstad said.

Decisions, decisions: The Angels still have not settled the issue of who will get the last seat in the bullpen. Manager Mike Scioscia remains undecided on whether he wants to add another power arm, a lefty or a long man.

If Kelvim Escobar is unable to start the season, for example, Kevin Gregg would likely slide into the rotation, creating the need for a long man.

"It is much too early in the spring to start to crystallize the team," Scioscia said.

Both Chris Bootcheck and Jake Woods have yet to allow a run this spring, while Scott Dunn has posted a 3.00 ERA and Matt Hensley has a 16.88 mark.

No sign, but close: Kendry Morales still has not arrived in camp, but Scioscia said he is just one signature away from getting his documents settled and gaining entrance into the United States. Morales has been working out at the Angels facility in the Dominican Republic as he awaits processing.

On deck: The Angels will host the Rangers at 12:05 p.m. PT on Friday at Tempe Diablo Stadium. Right-hander Bartolo Colon will start for the Angels against Rangers right-hander Juan Dominguez. Outfielders Vladimir Guerrero and Steve Finley, both out of Thursday's lineup, will return. Neither player has hit a homer this spring.
