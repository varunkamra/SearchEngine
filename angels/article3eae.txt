In a playing career that spanned 20 Major League seasons, Gary Gaetti was a rare talent who could help his team win with a home run or a great play in the field.
Though he never made more than $3 million in any season and averaged only $1.33 million per year, year in and year out, Gaetti remained one of the best all-around third basemen in the game.
By the time his sterling run finished in 2000, Gaetti had played for the Twins, Angels, Royals, Cardinals, Cubs and Red Sox, and had compiled 360 home runs, sixth most among Major League third basemen.
But he was also known for his glove. Gaetti found a spot in the record books on July 18, 1990, when he started two triple plays for the Twins in a game at Boston.
A two-time All-Star, Gaetti won four Gold Glove Awards and was named to the 1995 Sporting News Silver Slugger team. He is one of 38 players to record at least 2,200 hits and 360 home runs.

In the 1987 American League Championship Series, Gaetti hit .300 with two home runs and five RBIs, capturing MVP honors and helping the Twins on their road to winning the World Series.

Gaetti is on the Hall of Fame ballot for the first time in his career, and if his previous first-time appearances are any indication, his candidcacy bears watching.
