ANAHEIM -- It began as a day of good news for Kelvim Escobar, but it ended with yet another setback for the right-hander.

After an MRI found no further damage to his torn labrum in his right shoulder, Escobar tried to throw a flat-ground session on Friday, but had to stop after about 10 throws because of shoulder pain.

Escobar said he is contemplating having season-ending shoulder surgery, as he had been when he was initially diagnosed with the injury in March. First, however, he must decide if he wants to get a second opinion with Mets team doctor Dr. David Altchek.

Escobar began feeling shoulder pains after throwing three innings for Class A Rancho Cucamonga on Monday. Team physican Dr. Lewis Yocum found "shoulder irritation" on Tuesday, clearing Escobar to throw on Friday.

On Friday, before he threw, Escobar said that his shoulder "felt really good," after receiving a shot of cortisone Thursday.

Angels manager Mike Scioscia was optimistic that Escobar's pain was just a minor setback, but that was before the news broke that Escobar's shoulder began hurting again.

"The results showed no changes from the results of his MRI in the spring," Scioscia said. "It's certainly good news, and he's feeling much better. It's certainly a step in the right direction."

Scioscia later added that "it shouldn't take too much to get him back into a game."

Escobar, 32, is coming off a career season in which he set a career-high in wins with 18 and carried a 3.40 ERA. He was diagnosed with a torn labrum in late March after suffering through shoulder pains the last two months of the season.
