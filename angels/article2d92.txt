ANGELS 3, RANGERS 2 
at Surprise, Ariz. 
Friday, Feb. 29

Angels at the plate: Designated hitter Brandon Wood crushed a two-run, go-ahead homer to left field against former Angels farmhand Warner Madrigal in the eighth inning. Left fielder Nathan Haynes singled and walked -- he has reached base four times in five spring plate appearances -- and Peter Bourjas' single, followed by a steal in the eighth, made him 4-for-4 this spring. 

Rangers at the plate: Catcher Gerald Laird slammed a two-run homer to left against Rafael Rodriguez in the fifth inning. Second baseman Ian Kisler singled and doubled in his first two at-bats. 

Angels on the mound: Elite prospect Nick Adenhart opened with two scoreless innings, striking out one and walking none while pitching almost exclusively from the stretch after singles leading off both innings. Darren Oliver pitched a scoreless third inning. 

Rangers on the mound: Southpaw Matt Harrison worked two scoreless innings, inducing a double play to finish the second after walking a man and striking out one batter. Fellow lefty C.J. Wilson struck out two of the three men he faced in the fourth. 

Cactus League records: Angels 1-0-1; Rangers 0-1-1. 

Up next: The Angels host the Cubs on Saturday at Tempe Diablo Stadium. Right-hander Jered Weaver makes his first start of the spring. The Rangers play the Royals in Surprise. Right-hander Vicente Padilla is scheduled to make his spring debut.
