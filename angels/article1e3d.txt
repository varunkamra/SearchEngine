WASHINGTON -- When asked if he thought the Angels might become buyers near the trade deadline to solve their offensive woes, manager Mike Scioscia indicated he didn't think that would be necessary. Scioscia said he thinks his team has the talent to right its ship internally. 

Speaking to the press before Tuesday's game against the Nationals, Scioscia said he believes that his team's big bats are starting to pick up, and that he has the right bench players to insert in certain situations to solve any other offensive deficiencies. 

"I think we're all very confident in what these guys can do," Scioscia said. "We've seen glimpses of it here and there. We're comfortable that the offensive team that we have in our clubhouse isn't going to be beaten."



That's certainly been the case so far this season. The Angels rank 10th in the American League and 17th overall in team batting average, sporting a .259 mark. It certainly hasn't hurt them in the win column, however, as they have the second-most wins and the second-best record in the Majors.

Scioscia's assertion about his bats coming around has statistical backing as well. Several starters have hit above their season average in the last month, and the team as a whole is batting .289 in its last seven games. Los Angeles also has 19 home runs in 21 games in June compared to 20 home runs in 28 games in May. 

All those numbers combine into a future that has Scioscia convinced solutions to his offensive problems can all be found in his own locker room. Scioscia said his team has all the right tools, it just needs to get to the point where it is producing consistently. 

"There are some challenges we have that are very real and right in front of us, particularly on the offensive side, trying to get a little bit of continuity," Scioscia said. "That's very, very important for us."
