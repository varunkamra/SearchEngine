ANGELS 9, ROYALS 6
At Surprise, Ariz.
Friday, March 9

Angels at the plate: Erick Aybar went 5-for-6, scored two runs and drove in the go-ahead run with a single in the sixth. Maicer Izturis drove in two runs on two hits, including a two-run double that had given the Angels a lead in the fifth.

Royals at the plate: Mike Sweeney contributed a run-scoring double to tie the game and scored the go-ahead run when Angels right-hander Matt Wilhite was charged with a balk in a controversial call that led to Angels manager Mike Scioscia's ejection from the game in the fourth inning. David DeJesus tripled in three trips and Ross Gload reached base three times.

Angels on the mound: Right-hander Nick Adenhart, a 20-year-old non-roster invitee, pitched three hitless innings, and the only baserunners he allowed came on a pair of walks. Phil Seibel, who followed Adenhart, wasn't nearly as effective, as he retired just one of the five batters he faced.

Royals on the mound: Luke Hudson started and pitched 3 2/3 innings, allowing one run on five hits while walking two and striking out three. The lone run Hudson allowed came on an infield single that third baseman Alex Gordon was unable to come up with cleanly.

Cactus League records: Angels 7-3, Royals 5-5

Up next: Kansas City's Jorge De La Rosa starts against the Cubs' Ted Lilly in a matchup of left-handers on Saturday at Surprise Stadium. Ervin Santana takes his Cactus League scoreless streak of five innings out against Seattle at Tempo Diablo Stadium. Both contests are scheduled for 1:05 p.m. PT.
