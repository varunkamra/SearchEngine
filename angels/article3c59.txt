ANGELS 8, GIANTS (SS) 1
at Tempe, Ariz.
Sunday, March 8

Giants at the plate: Andres Torres, John Bowker, Rich Aurilia, Jesus Guzman and Scott McClain had a hit apiece as a stripped Giants squad (their big boys were in Phoenix for a split-squad game against Oakland) went quietly. San Francisco did not hit a home run after connecting in its first 12 games.










Angels at the plate: Juan Rivera and Reggie Willits paced a varied offense with two hits apiece as the Angels ran their spring record to a Majors-best 9-1 with their sixth straight victory. Andrew Romine laced a two-run triple in the fourth to break the game open.

Giants on the mound: Jack Taschner, Brandon Medders and Alex Hinshaw were the only Giants pitchers to avoid damage, hurling a shutout inning apiece.

Angels on the mound: Five pitchers contributed as the Angels continued their uncanny pitching in Arizona's thin, dry air; they've allowed a total of 31 runs in 10 games, and the White Sox are next lowest in the Cactus League with 39 runs allowed. Nick Adenhart bolstered his rotation candidacy by blanking the Giants on two hits through three innings, fanning one without issuing a walk. Kevin Jepsen and non-roster invitees Ryan Brasier and Barret Browning combined for shutout innings.

Cactus League records: Giants 5-8; Angels 9-1

Up next: The Giants host the Brewers at Scottsdale Stadium on Monday, with Barry Zito set to make his third start, opposite Manny Parra. The Angels travel to Phoenix to meet the A's, with Joe Saunders facing Dallas Braden in another battle of left-handers.
