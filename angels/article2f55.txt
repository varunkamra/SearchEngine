ANAHEIM -- Second baseman Howie Kendrick and shortstop Erick Aybar, who are both nursing strained left hamstrings, participated in agility exercises on Monday and came out feeling well.



Kendrick, who was batting .307 before pulling his left hamstring on Aug. 27, has been on the 15-day disabled list since Aug. 28. And Aybar, who also experienced tightness in his left hamstring during the same game, has avoided the disabled list but still hasn't played since the injury.



The two resumed baseball activities on Friday and their workout before the Angels played the Yankees on Monday went well, according to Angels manager Mike Scioscia.



"Howie and Erick are making progress," Scioscia said. "They made it through agilities fine and stepped it up to some good striders. They had a chance to test it and see where they were and they came out great."



But the two aren't expected to play during the Angels' current seven-game homestand and haven't even begun running the bases yet.



"It's still baby steps right now," Scioscia said. "But it's the first indication that things are going the right way."



The hope is that both players return with enough at-bats to get ready for the postseason, but Scioscia still won't talk about the playoff situation until the Angels have clinched. For now, he's just hoping the two infielders show enough progress to return soon.



"There is a progression you have to go through and it's going to take a while," Scioscia said. "They need to gradually build up their intensity and reps until the medical staff feels that it's not a risk to go out there and run the bases."
