Angels manager Mike Scioscia is looking forward to Ervin Santana's Major League debut Tuesday night.


"His talent is eye-opening," said Scioscia. "We feel he's ready."



Santana, 22, is making the jump from Double-A Arkansas, where he was 5-1 with a 2.31 ERA in seven starts. Santana is a power pitcher with a good fastball and slider.


"He has a good fastball, a power breaking ball and a changeup," said Scioscia.


With right-hander Kelvim Escobar (bone spur in elbow) out, Scioscia said Santana probably will get more than one start.
