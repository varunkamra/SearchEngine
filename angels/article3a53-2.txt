LAS VEGAS -- Three Angels pitchers -- right-handers Darren O'Day, Robert Mosebach and Miguel Gonzalez -- were selected on Thursday in the Major League phase of the Rule 5 Draft at the cost of $50,000 by the Mets, Phillies and Red Sox, respectively.

If they are not on their new club's Major League roster all season, they will be offered back to the Angels for $25,000.





O'Day, 26, made the Angels' Opening Day roster in 2008 with a brilliant spring and appeared in 30 games with a 4.57 ERA in middle relief. The sidearmer was taken by the Mets with the 15th overall pick. He was also 2-2 with a 3.27 ERA and seven saves in 21 games at Triple-A Salt Lake.

Mosebach, 24, was 9-12 with a 4.62 ERA in 29 starts at Double-A Arkansas. The Phillies chose him at No. 17.

Taken one pick later by the Red Sox, Gonzalez, 24, spent the 2008 season recovering from a torn meniscus in Spring Training. With experience as a starter and reliever, the slender righty is having a strong winter for Mazatlan in the Mexican Pacific League. He is 3-1 with a 0.99 ERA in 24 appearances, with 32 strikeouts against eight walks.

"Those are three good pitchers," Angels general manager Tony Reagins said. "We just didn't feel they were ready for a roster spot.

"The three guys who were selected were guys we'd have looked at in camp. When you lose pitching, you have to replace it. We have good Minor League talent from a pitching standpoint."

O'Day had cleared waivers, meaning the Mets could have taken him at a cost of $25,000 if they'd put in a claim.

The Angels made no selections in the Rule 5 Draft.
