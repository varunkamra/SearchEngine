TEMPE, Ariz. -- Orlando Cabrera is surrounded by possibly the best collection of middle infield prospects in this spring's camp, but the nine-year veteran takes it in stride.

"There is a lot of talent here, a lot of talent," Cabrera said of second basemen Howie Kendrick and Alberto Callaspo, and shortstops Erick Aybar and Brandon Wood.

Cabrera signed a four-year deal prior to last season and replaced fan favorite David Eckstein at shortstop in the process. Though it took a while for the hometown crowd to warm up to him, Cabrera helped put a thaw in relations by showcasing his Gold Glove skills and helping to anchor one of the best defenses in baseball last year.

Aybar is an excellent fielder, while Wood has shown considerable power up to the Class A level, but Cabrera slaps his glove and takes an easy breath while not being concerned of who might be gaining on him, however considerable their talent might be.

"I never think about it, because when I was in the Minors, I never thought about the guys ahead of me," Cabrera said. "So now that I have a good job, I don't need to think about it. I just need to look forward."

Utilitarianism: When the Angels acquired Edgardo Alfonzo in exchange for outfielder Steve Finley, they gained another player capable of handling multiple duties. Alfonzo has played both third base and second in his career, and the Angels will work him out at both positions in addition to first.

"Edgardo is a guy that has played at a very high level for a lot of years, and he has an experienced right-handed bat," manager Mike Scioscia said.

Having players like Alfonzo in addition to Chone Figgins, Juan Rivera, Darin Erstad, Robb Quinlan and Maicer Izturis, who each can play multiple positions, may prove to be an added benefit when the roster is whittled to 25.

One area that might impact is designated hitter, a spot which Rivera is the leading candidate in the early going of spring. But some other names continue to surface who might get at-bats at the position, certainly in the spring if not during the season.

Dallas McPherson and Tim Salmon are two who are battling for jobs this spring, but if they are productive in the Cactus League schedule, that could fold into the regular season.

"Historically, if we can get one guy locked into DH, we will be more productive, but we might not be able to do that," Scioscia said. "The versatility of our team gives us depth, and that might allow us to carry an extra bat or a DH on the team."

On target: Kelvim Escobar and Bartolo Colon both threw live batting practice on Wednesday with varying degrees of intensity. Colon remained free and easy while throwing mostly fastballs, but Escobar was far more active and mixed in a number of breaking pitches.

"In Bart, we're seeing a steady progress," Scioscia said. "Escobar is through the roof; he has really picked it up."

The Angels are hoping to evaluate both pitchers as much as possible over the next few days before they depart for Florida to train for the World Baseball Classic.

"We feel much better about the workout Bart had and where he'll be for the World Baseball Classic and for us," Scioscia said.

There is an intrasquad game scheduled for Feb. 28 and possibly another on March 1, with the spring schedule following after that.

"There is still some guarded optimism," Scioscia said. "We'll see them in a couple of more workouts and hopefully some games, but we have to see how they come out of it, and they do, too."

On his way: Francisco Rodriguez has cleared his paper hurdles and is expected to be in camp on Thursday.

"We understand he picked up his visa and will be here [on Thursday] some time," Scioscia said. "We don't know the exact time, but he is en route."
