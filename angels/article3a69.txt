Stephen Marek's first professional win was a doozy.

The 2004 40th-round draft-and-follow showed why the Los Angeles Angels signed him for a reported $800,000 in May, allowing just one hit and striking out 12 in six innings as he led the Orem Owlz to an 11-0 win over the visiting Great Falls White Sox on Thursday night. The brilliant performance earned Marek the MiLB.com "Star of the Day."

The 21-year-old fireballer struck out the first four batters of the game before getting into a jam, which was caused by an error, a wild pitch and the only hit he would allow -- a single by Daron Roberts. But Marek coaxed a double play grounder off the bat of Matt Sharp and then didn't allow a hit over the next four innings.

With a fastball that has been clocked in the high 90s, Marek was nearly untouchable, fanning the side three times in the game. The only White Sox batter to reach base against him after the second inning was Brandon Allen, who struck out but took first on a passed ball.

Marek was widely considered the top junior college pitcher in the country while serving as a closer for Houston's San Jacinto College. He was projected to a be a second- to fourth-round draft pick in 2005 had the Angels not reached a deal with him.

The conversion from reliever to starter has not been without its bumps for Marek. The 6-foot-2 Texan was 0-2 with a 4.59 ERA in his first nine appearances.  His six innings pitched and 12 strikeouts were both season bests.
