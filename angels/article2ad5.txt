Angels infielder Brandon Wood was released from his Dominican Winter League team after batting .167 in 48 at-bats for Estrellas, according to a report in the Los Angeles Times.



Wood was dismissed after 13 games after striking out 16 times in 48 at-bats while hitting just one home run.



But Wood remains one of the top prospects for the Angels and could see plenty of playing time on the left side of the Angels infield next season.



One such scenario could see third baseman Chone Figgins playing in the outfield to make room for Wood, who was the club's best hitter for the Triple-A Salt Lake Bees and played well down the stretch for the Angels.



Wood batted .296 with 31 homers and 84 RBIs in 103 games at Triple-A Salt Lake and hit .200 with five home runs and 13 RBIs in 55 games with the Angels.



But Wood played much better late in the season for the Angels, as he batted .256 with four home runs and 11 RBIs in 26 games after getting called up in late August. He also played superb defense and earned himself a spot on the playoff roster.



Meanwhile, fellow Angels player Kendry Morales is off to a hot start in the Dominican Winter League, batting .455 with five home runs in his first 12 games. Morales is expected to take over at first base if the Angels can't resign free agent Mark Teixeira.
