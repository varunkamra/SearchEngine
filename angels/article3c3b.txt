TEMPE, Ariz. -- This is hard to fathom.

Howard Joseph Kendrick III actually had a slump in the Minors. It is true. Believe it.

Yes, the same Howie Kendrick who hit .367 in the past two minor league seasons, .368 in 2003 and .318 in 2002 in the Arizona Rookie League after the Angels picked him in the 10th round of the First-Year Player Draft out of St. John's River Community College in Palatka, Fla.

Kendrick was sent to Provo, the Angels' Advanced Rookie club in the Pioneer League in 2003. He began the season 4-for-40.

"I've experienced a slump before," Kendrick said on Saturday. "That was the lowest point for me. It was tough times, but your teammates help you through those times.

"I was at the point, to where like, 'Oh my goodness, what is wrong with my swing, what is this and that?' Now that I'm older, I know it is more of a mental thing. It wasn't really anything in my mechanics, but I'm glad I experienced it because I learned from it."

There's a baseball proverb that one can learn the most about a young player once he experiences failure and how he reacts. Kendrick responded after that sordid start to hit .428 in July and August and won the league batting title with a .367 average.

His final 2005 totals at Double-A Arkansas and  Class A Rancho Cucamonga: .367, the second-highest mark in the Minors, with 104 runs, 43 doubles, eight triples, 19 home runs, 89 RBIs and 25 stolen bases.

In short, Kendrick is a hitting machine.

"I wouldn't say that so much," Kendrick said and grinned. "Hopefully, I'll stay ahead in the count and try to hit early in the count. I think I'm just more of an aggressive-style hitter. My hand-eye coordination is pretty good. For the most part, you have to have the ability to hit and it is a thinking game, too. You have to have an idea of what to look for at the plate, here and there.

"For the most part, you kind of sit on the hard stuff and when they start throwing you soft stuff, you've got to adjust," continued Kendrick. "It is all about making adjustments and if you can do that, you'll be a good hitter. As far as hitting goes, I've always been able to do that."

Kendrick, who his hitting .263 in eight March games, is focusing on defense in camp.

"I just try to learn about everything, try to get as much insight because being here in Spring Training, you get an opportunity to be around all these guys and it is your one chance to try to learn from them."

No game: The Angels' bus was scheduled to leave at 11:45 a.m. MT for Maryville and a Saturday afternoon game with the Brewers. The bus, however, never left as the first rainy day in Phoenix since October postponed the game.

Pitching coach Bud Black said with a doubleheader on Sunday, they would be able to cover the missed innings.

Black said right-hander Jeff Weaver, who was scheduled to start against the Brewers, will pitch on Sunday. Jason Bulger, the right-hander the Angels acquired in a Feb. 28 trade with the Diamondbacks, is also scheduled to pitch against the Athletics.

Black said right-handers Greg Jones, David Austen, Nick Adenhart and Bob Zimmermann "will likely be on one of those lists" for Sunday duty.


Injury update: Infielder Robb Quinlan, who has a bruise after fouling a ball off his shin on Friday, is listed as day-to-day. Outfielder Nick Gorneault sprained his left wrist while sliding into second base on Friday, but should be OK to return soon.


Versatile Carrasco: With the Feb. 15 signing of Weaver, the Angels' rotation is full, but if they need a spot starter, Hector Carrasco could fill that role.

The 36-year-old Carrasco has pitched in the Majors with the Reds, Royals, Twins, Orioles and Nationals, mostly in relief. He also spent 2004 in Japan. In two spring starts, he has a 3.86 ERA.

"He had a big year for Washington," Black said. "He's a much different pitcher now than early in his career. He's pitching now instead of throwing. He made five starts for the Nationals. He could start."

Carrasco has a 1-1 record with a 1.88 ERA in six career starts.


Briefly: Tim Salmon, who is trying to come back after missing last season with rotator cuff surgery and knee surgery, is 8-for-16 this spring. ... Cuban defector Kendry Morales is 8-for-21 with a .571 slugging percentage. ... Right-hander Ervin Santana has allowed no runs and one hit in five innings, while striking out five. ... Highly touted pitching prospect Chris Bootcheck is 2-0 with a 0.00 ERA in his first five innings. ... Casey Kotchman is hitting .412.

Upcoming: The Angels have two road games on Sunday, both starting at 12:05 p.m. PT. Weaver is scheduled to start against the Athletics at Phoenix Stadium. The righty is 0-0 with a 4.91 ERA in his first two appearances, allowing five hits, walking four and striking out four in 3 2/3 innings. The Angels' split squad will also play the White Sox at Tucson.
