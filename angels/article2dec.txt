ANAHEIM -- Howie Kendrick left Monday night's game against Cleveland in the fourth inning with what the team said was diagnosed as a jammed right thumb. He is listed as day-to-day.

Kendrick injured the thumb in his first at-bat of the night against Indians starter Fausto Carmona. He grounded out in the third inning and was removed for pinch-hitter Erick Aybar in the fourth inning. Aybar took over at shortstop and Maicer Izturis moved from shortstop to second base.

Kendrick began the night as the Angels' leading hitter with a .444 average and had hit safely in the first seven games of the year. He began the night leading the American League with 12 hits.
