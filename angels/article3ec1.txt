ANAHEIM -- When Angels manager Mike Scioscia says routinely that he's searching for groupings for his team's batting lineup he's not kidding.



The Angels have shuffled their lineup all season because of injuries and inconsistency. They have used 67 total batting orders in 84 games this season and their most common lineup has been used just five times.



The Angels moved around their lineup again on Tuesday against the A's, hoping the new order will stick when they host Oakland again on Wednesday in the series finale.



Casey Kotchman moved into the second spot for the fourth time this season and Maicer Izturis batted third for the first time. Both batters are known for working counts and getting on-base, which is something Scioscia wants to see at the top of his lineup.



"We've juggled lineups to try to get the groupings to create offense," Scioscia said. "Our preference would be when guys are solid and playing their game and you get one lineup every day. The roles would be very clear and the situational hitting is defined. But we haven't seen consistency to pencil guys in, even from one to six or seven."



The offense has been struggling so bad that Tuesday marked the first time in five games that the Angels scored at least two runs. Scioscia again said the key is to find a grouping of players who hit well together even if the entire lineup doesn't produce.



"If we can get guys, not even the whole team, just three or four guys to get into their game, there's a lot these guys can do," Scioscia said. "We're not seeing it at all. This is as stagnant as I've seen from this group."



The one positive for the Angels is that they hit the ball well against Oakland starter Dana Eveland when he pitched against them on April 30. The Angels roughed up Eveland for six runs over 5 1/3 innings. But Eveland has allowed two earned runs or fewer in each of his past four starts.






Pitching matchup
LAA: LHP Joe Saunders (11-4, 3.06 ERA)
Saunders wasn't razor-sharp, needing 70 pitches to get 12 outs on his way to allowing three runs (two earned) in five innings against the Dodgers on Friday night at Dodger Stadium. But he pitched well enough to keep his team in the game and did nothing to damage his case for an All-Star Game berth. Saunders wasn't hurt by his four walks while striking out four, but they elevated his pitch count. Back on more familiar AL West turf, Saunders beat the A's 2-0 on April 29 at home, holding them to four hits across eight innings. He's 3-1 with a 4.24 ERA in six career outings against Oakland.


OAK: LHP Dana Eveland (6-5, 3.34 ERA)
Eveland appeared to have the command he said he's been missing during his past few appearances in his most recent start against the Giants. He limited San Francisco to just one run on five hits while walking two and striking out three in 7 1/3 innings. It was the fourth time in 16 starts he lasted at least seven innings and the seventh time he walked two batters or fewer. In his first career start against the Angels on April 30, Eveland was tagged with the loss after giving up six earned runs on seven hits in 5 1/3 innings.

Tidbits
Right-handed reliever Chris Bootcheck, who is on the disabled list with a strained right forearm, is scheduled to pitch two innings for Class A Rancho Cucamonga on Wednesday. If all goes well he will pitch one inning on Thursday to build up his stamina. He said Tuesday that physically he feels good and his velocity is up, but there's no timetable for his return. ... If the Angels continue the pace with their record of 16-20 when scoring three or fewer runs, it would be the sixth-best record based on winning percentage in baseball's history, according to Stats LLC. All five teams ahead of the Angels' current pace at least made the World Series. ... Vladimir Guerrero's .375 batting average in June was the third highest in baseball.
