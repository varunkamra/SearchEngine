ANAHEIM -- The Angels took care of some business Friday by signing catchers Jeff Mathis and Mike Napoli, infielder Howie Kendrick and outfielders Tommy Murphy and Reggie Willits to one-year contracts.

Mathis, who will be competing with Jose Molina for a starting job this spring, spent most of last season at Triple-A Salt Lake. The 22-year-old batted .276 with 26 doubles, 21 home runs and 73 RBIs in 112 games. Mathis was named to the Pacific Coast League All-Star team and was named defensive player of the year in the Angels organization. He made two quick trips to the Angels last season, appearing in five games. Mathis collected his first Major League hit Aug. 29 with a single at Oakland.

Kendrick split time between Class A Rancho Cucamonga, where he hit .384, and Double-A Arkansas, where he hit .342. Kendrick, 22, was also named to the California League All-Star team and was named the Angels' co-Minor League player of the year along with Brandon Wood. Napoli spent 2005 at Double-A Arkansas. The 24-year-old hit .237 with 22 doubles and led the Texas League with 31 home runs and 99 RBIs.

Murphy led the Texas League with 11 triples while batting .288. The 26-year-old also had 24 doubles, 17 homers, 76 RBIs and 26 stolen bases. Willits, 24, hit .304 with 23 doubles and 40 stolen bases at Arkansas.
