OAKLAND -- As the Angels' elder statesman, Garret Anderson recognizes that he plays a role in the clubhouse chemistry that has enabled the American League West leaders to flourish not only as the Majors' best road team this season, but since 2004.

Yet, in characteristic fashion, he quickly diverts the attention over to someone else -- in this case, his manager, Mike Scioscia -- when he's asked to define the intangibles enabling this club to maintain a high performance level in unfriendly environs.

"Veteran leadership comes into play," Anderson acknowledged. "Younger guys can just deal with playing the game. They don't have to worry about why we're losing, that kind of thing. They can just focus on their game.

"Mike doesn't get too high or too low, either. The manager has something to do with that [chemistry]. His attitude filters down through the team. Obviously, you come to play every day, but there's no sense of urgency -- like you have to win that day. You do what you can today and then move on. He's been steady with that."

So has Anderson, who is, as teammate Casey Kotchman puts it, "the same guy every day. Whether he goes 3-for-4 or 0-for-4, he's doing the same things, acting the same way."

That cool professionalism embodied by Anderson runs through the ranks, creating a calm, businesslike manner in the clubhouse. On the field, the Angels' road success is a blend of factors: deep, resourceful pitching, intelligent, efficient defense, the ability to create offense without total dependence on any individual - even one as great as Vladimir Guerrero -- or the long ball.

"We're not a power team," Anderson said. "We don't rely on that. We move runners, make things happen on the bases. With that style, you can manufacture runs in any park."

The Angels will try to generate offense behind Jon Garland when they face southpaw Greg Smith in the second game of this series against the A's.

Anderson has manufactured more than his share over the years. The franchise leader in RBIs with 1,235 and he's six runs away from breaking former teammate Tim Salmon's club record (986).


Pitching matchup
LAA: RHP Jon Garland (5-3, 3.99 ERA)
Coming off a superb May (2-0, 1.78 ERA in five starts), Garland struggled to get through five innings while yielding three runs against the Jays on Sunday. A 44-pitch first inning left him in a hole, but he kept the team in a game it eventually won. Garland is 3-1 with a 3.00 ERA in five road starts. The A's knocked him around (seven earned runs, 10 hits in six innings) in an April 28 loss at home. Garland is 3-9 in 14 career starts against the A's but pitched better (3.86 ERA) than his 2-5 record suggests at McAfee Coliseum during his White Sox days.

OAK: LHP Greg Smith (3-4, 3.56 ERA)
Smith finally had a bad outing in the A's 13-8 victory over Texas on Sunday. The Rookie of the Year candidate allowed seven runs in five innings. The left-hander was more unlucky than anything, giving up several ground-ball hits in a five-run sixth that cost him a chance at a victory. Smith had a strong May with a 2.97 ERA for five starts. He led all American League rookies with 49 strikeouts before punching out four against the Rangers.

Tidbits
The Angels are 11-2 against left-handed starters -- a marked improvement over last season when they finished 19-21 against southpaws. Kotchman's .417 torching of lefties has been a big factor in the turnaround along with consistent production from Gary Matthews Jr. (.277, eight RBIs), Robb Quinlan (.321) and Torii Hunter (.308). Disabled infielders Erick Aybar (.382) and Chone Figgins (.333) also have hammered lefties. ... Hunter leads the club with 101 total bases and 31 runs scored. He is one homer away from 200 in his career.
