ANAHEIM -- She comes from a game where swinging and hitting are part of the language, and played high school volleyball not that far away from Angel Stadium -- so it only figured that Misty May-Treanor would one day serve a ball there.

Well, so the first pitch isn't quite a serve. And nobody is quite sure if a strike should be counted as a service ace.

May-Treanor threw out the first pitch before Wednesday night's Angels game against the A's. She is back in her hometown to play in the AVP Crocs Tour Cuervo Gold Crown Huntington Beach Open.

May-Treanor was an Olympic gold medalist with partner Kerri Walsh in 2004 and is a favorite to repeat in Beijing this summer. May-Treanor and Walsh are the current beach volleyball world champions. May-Treanor also has more tournament victories (75) than any other female player in AVP history. She and Walsh have won the first two AVP tournaments of the season.

May-Treanor is an Orange County native. She starred at Newport Harbor High School and played college volleyball at Long Beach State. She is married to Florida Marlins catcher Matt Treanor.

The AVP Crocs Tour Cuervo Gold Crown Huntington Beach Open begins Thursday and continues through Sunday at the Huntington Beach Pier. It is the third of 18 tour stops this season.
