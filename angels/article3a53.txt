ANAHEIM -- Torii Hunter was on the other end of a jolt on Friday afternoon, when he was rear-ended as he waited in his car at a stop light on Katella Avenue within a mile of Angel Stadium.

The accident was so minor to Hunter, he didn't even mention it to manager Mike Scioscia. The center fielder was in the lineup, batting fifth, for the first of three weekend games against the Mariners.

"I feel it in my back," Hunter said, "but nobody was seriously hurt. My Bentley's going to have to go in the hospital for a while."

Hunter was in the right lane, waiting for the light to change, when he looked in his rearview mirror and saw the driver of the sedan apply his blinker and begin to switch over from the middle lane. As he was looking over his shoulder to check traffic behind him, the driver smacked into Hunter's vehicle.

"I was so upset," Hunter said. "I couldn't feel anything right away. I feel a little stiffness now, like hitting a wall."

New to the Southern California freeway system after spending the past decade in Minnesota with the Twins, Hunter had just come off the freeway when the accident happened at about 2:15 p.m. PT.

"Good thing it didn't happen on the freeway," Hunter said. "It could have been a lot worse."

After exchanging insurance information with the other driver, he was able to drive his car to the ballpark and be in uniform in time for stretching and batting practice.

"Man, I hadn't been in an accident in 15 years," Hunter said, shaking his head.
