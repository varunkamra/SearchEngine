ANAHEIM -- Maybe it's because of all the years Angels manager Mike Scioscia spent in the National League. Maybe it's because the Angels have an NL small-ball-type offense. Maybe it's just plain luck.



There has to be reason for the Angels' success in Interleague Play. After all, the Angels are 18-5 in their last 23 games against their NL counterparts. But if you ask around the clubhouse, Angels players can't put a finger on why they've had such success.



Angels catcher Mike Napoli said, "It could be coincidence that games have gone that way." And Angels first baseman Casey Kotchman said, "There's probably no specific reason."



Napoli and Kotchman are certainly a part of that trend, as they are batting .286 and .357 in Interleague Play in their careers, respectively. And they're obviously not the only Angels with those kinds of statistics, as the team hit .330 against NL pitching last season.





The Angels will look to continue that kind of success when they resume Interleague Play against the Braves and starter Jo-Jo Reyes on Friday.



The Angels have played Atlanta just once in Interleague Play, going 2-1 against the Braves at Turner Field in 2005. Even though the two clubs haven't met in three years, Kotchman said there's no difference in preparation.



"You watch baseball on TV a lot, so that helps," Kotchman said. "It's a little different playing them on the field, but at least you've seen them. The scouting reports are still the same."



Atlanta will have to rely on scouting reports to figure out Angels starter Jon Garland, as he has never faced the Braves in his nine-year Major League career. The 6-foot-6 right-hander is coming off a performance in which he struck out a season-high eight batters against the A's.



"He's shown great offspeed stuff recently and has been pitching well right now," said Napoli, who has seven home runs in 97 career Interleague at-bats. "He's just a good pitcher."



But Garland will have his work cut out for him against a tough Atlanta offense, which boasts a .275 team batting average, fourth highest in baseball.



Interleague record: 106-91 overall, 2-1 in 2008

Pitching matchup
LAA: RHP Jon Garland (6-3, 3.87 ERA)
Garland has been on a roll recently and hasn't lost since April 28. In his last start, against the A's on Saturday, he carried a shutout into the eighth inning before allowing a two-run home run to Travis Buck. He went seven-plus innings and picked up his third consecutive win. Garland is 8-11 with a 4.49 ERA lifetime in Interleague Play.


ATL: LHP Jo-Jo Reyes (2-4, 4.80 ERA)
Reyes has run into a little bad luck, pitching well in his last three starts, but he has an 0-2 record to show for it. He pitched 7 1/3 innings, giving up four runs on seven hits against the Phillies on Saturday. The lefty has never faced the Angels before, but he won his only Interleague start when he allowed two runs in five innings against the A's on May 18.
