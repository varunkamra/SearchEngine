The Angels fell Tuesday but can still take their Interleague series from Washington with a win Wednesday.

The Halos will send ace Bartolo Colon to the hill. Colon is 4-0 over his last six starts and has allowed only 82 hits and 21 walks in 87 1/3 innings this season.

The Nationals will start Ryan Drese, whom they claimed off waivers from Texas on Friday. Drese has given up five or more runs in seven of his 12 starts this season, including his last two outings for the Rangers. He is 4-3 with a 4.19 ERA in seven career starts against the Angels.

The Angels led, 3-1, Tuesday, but a two-run homer by Jose Guillen keyed a four-run eighth by the Nationals against Scot Shields (5-4). Starter Ervin Santana allowed only four hits and one run in 6 1/3 innings.
