Angels closer Francisco Rodriguez had one of his worst outings in recent memory on Monday night, blowing a save against the Indians by allowing three runs in one-third of an inning.

Rodriguez said after the game that he wouldn't be surprised if his sore ankles landed him on the disabled list. 

The Angels will evaluate Rodriguez today and decide what the next move is.


Manager Mike Scioscia said he knew Rodriguez was in trouble immediately.

"You could see with every pitch that he was laboring a little bit more," Scioscia said. "We might have to sit him for three or four days before we make a decision."

That decision might come sooner rather than later.
The Angels pitching status means that starters need to be getting deep into as many games as possible.

Ervin Santana, who has always been a successful home pitcher, will try to beat the Indians for the first time in his career. 

The Angels beat the Indians to bail out Rodriguez on Torii Hunter's grand slam in the bottom of the ninth inning.

Hunter said after the game that he was happiest about the fact that his first multi-home run performance as an Angel came in a game where his team needed it most. 

"I think it's a sign that he's getting more comfortable," Scioscia said. 

Comfort is a good thing for the Angels right now, which certainly have a good share of worry despite a winning record eight games into the season.




Pitching matchup
LAA: RHP Ervin Santana (1-0, 3.00 ERA)
Santana pitched well in his season debut on the road against the Minnesota Twins. The fact that it came on the road was a good sign for Santana, whose road struggles have been well chronicled. He also stepped up at a time when the Angels are down two starting pitchers. Santana gave up two runs in six innings against the Twins and showed consistent poise, which he must bring into his start against the Indians, who have owned him since he arrived in the Major Leagues in 2005. In his career, Santana is 0-5 with a 7.59 ERA against Cleveland and was 0-3 with a 5.82 ERA in 2007.


CLE: RHP Jake Westbrook (0-1, 2.45 ERA)
Westbrook pitched well against the Angels last year but with minimal success. He was 0-1 with a 2.63 ERA in two starts. Westbrook has historically been a tough-luck pitcher against the Halos. He is only 2-5 but has a 3.12 career ERA (20 earned runs in 57 2/3 innings, 57 hits). Westbrook gave up two runs and six hits in seven innings in his first start of the season last week against the White Sox. 

Tidbits
Right-hander John Lackey, on the disabled list with a strained right triceps, is on track to resume throwing off a flat surface next week, Scioscia said. ... One week into the season, Howie Kendrick and Gary Matthews Jr. are the hottest Angels. Kendrick entered play Monday leading the American League with 12 hits and was second in the AL with a .444 average (12-for-27). ... Matthews has hit safely in all eight games his season.
