TEMPE, Ariz. -- Three to make two used to work in the NBA, but something will have to give this spring at the competition for catcher.

Unlike the NBA rule that allowed players three free-throw attempts to make two before being phased out in 1981, the three main catchers battling for jobs with the Angels will not fit into two slots.

"It is going to be good; we have three good catchers here and we just have to go out and play," Mike Napoli, who moved from third on the depth chart last spring to the leader in the clubhouse, said on Thursday as pitchers and catchers held their initial workouts of the spring. "We'll see what happens."

Napoli is joined by two familiar names at the position in Jose Molina and Jeff Mathis and each is equal to Napoli's philosophical approach, choosing to remain unconcerned with the closed-door meetings that are held throughout camp.

"I don't see a competition here; just guys going out to play the game," said the veteran Molina. "It is another decision; it doesn't matter what you do. Other years I've done well and still been sent to the Minors. It is out of my control."

The Angels are a catching rich organization as evidenced by the eight men taking up residence in the catchers' corner of the Spring Training complex at Tempe Diablo Stadium. It has also been rich at the Major League level, with as many as three getting nods to the 25-man roster in the past. But that is unlikely for 2007.

"We've looked at a couple different scenarios," manager Mike Scioscia said. "Three is probably a long shot although there are a couple things that can help us with three. Most likely it's going to be two."

Bobby Wilson, who had a solid year at Double-A Arkansas last season and has been added to the 40-man roster, faces long odds to win a job and will likely back up at Triple-A Salt Lake. The other catchers in camp are Brent Del Chiaro, Tim Duff, Ben Johnson and Flint Wipke.

But as it was a year ago, the two jobs will be contested by the three main combatants with adjustments made only to the depth chart.

With former starter Bengie Molina out of the equation last spring, Mathis was the heir apparent and led throughout camp, landing a job on the Opening Day roster. But in a case of too much, too soon, Mathis struggled through the first month with four hits in 39 at-bats that included one homer and two RBIs.

Mathis was replaced by Napoli, a move that quickly altered the order of things as Napoli hit eight home runs in his first two months in a big-league uniform. Mathis stayed in Salt Lake until September callups but regained some much-needed confidence at the plate.

"He put some pressure on himself in every aspect of catching and consequently I think he struggled because he was trying to do things that were not going to happen for a young catcher," Scioscia said. "When he came back he had a different look in his eye and he'll be better this spring."

Napoli looks to be better this season, but he assured himself that he will be thinner, about 15 pounds by his own estimation. He said he improved his diet and worked out near his home with the hope of being more equipped to withstand the rigors of a full Major League season. After nearly a straight year of activity, he also opted out of playing winter ball.

"I felt I was getting a little sloppy by the end of the year," said Napoli, who hit .286 with 11 homers and 27 RBIs before the All-Star break but .164 with five home runs and 15 RBIs after it.

The offensive numbers were a concern and Napoli said he will change his approach, but Scioscia is more concerned with production behind the plate.

"If you look at his won-loss, it was solid all the way through and actually got better, so what Mike brings to the ballpark was there for the whole year," Scioscia said. "There was no lapse at all for our club."

Jose Molina struggled offensively in the first two months of last season, but hit .282 from June on, after he threw concerns about playing time aside and concentrated on playing ball.

"I finished strong and that is what is important," Molina said. "I know what I have to do."

However the competition unfolds, Scioscia figures it'll fall to capable hands.

"I think Mike Napoli certainly made a strong statement, everything from handling pitchers to the way he controls the running game is what we need. Jose Molina did much of the same, so both of those guys did a great job," Scioscia said. "And Jeff Mathis has as much upside as any young player coming up from the Minor Leagues."
