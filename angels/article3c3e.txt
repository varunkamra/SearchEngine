Kelvim Escobar makes his second start of the season on Saturday when the Angels face the Twins at the Metrodome.



Escobar missed the first three weeks of the season with a sprained right elbow, but returned to throw six scoreless innings against Oakland on April 24.

If the game comes down to speed, the top two base-stealers in the American League could help decide it. The Angels' Chone Figgins stole a base for the third straight game on Friday. His nine steals trail only Minnesota's Torii Hunter, who is 10-for-10 on the year.
