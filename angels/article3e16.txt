ANAHEIM -- John Lackey took another step toward returning to the Angels rotation Tuesday.

The right-hander allowed an earned run on a hit and a walk with two strikeouts over three innings in a rehab start with the Class A Quakes at Lake Elsinore before a blackout suspended play. Lackey later returned to throw 26 pitches in a simulated game in the bullpen to bring his total to 60 pitches for the night.

Lackey, who strained his right triceps in Spring Training and opened the season on the disabled list, is scheduled to make two more rehab starts with Class A Rancho Cucamonga before returning to the Angels complex in Tempe, Ariz., for extended Spring Training.

Manager Mike Scioscia said the club wants to bring him along there and get his pitch-counts to a level where he will be able to start.

The Angels, who are also without starter Kelvim Escobar, hope Lackey can return to the rotation by the end of May barring any setbacks.

Infielder Mark Brown was called up and catcher Bobby Wilson was optioned to Triple-A Salt Lake following the Angels' 2-0 victory over the A's on Tuesday.
