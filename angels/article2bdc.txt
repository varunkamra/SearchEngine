TEMPE, Ariz. -- Gary Matthews Jr. views himself as an everyday Major League outfielder, so it came as no surprise when he stormed out of a meeting with the brass on Sunday at the team's Spring Training facility and did not accompany the team for a trip to Surprise, Ariz., for a game against his former team, the Rangers.

"We just let Gary know where things stand at this point in the season, and that's about all I can say about it," manager Mike Scioscia said of the meeting also attended by general manager Tony Reagins. "We were honest with him, and he let us know how he feels.











"Gary wants to play, and that's understandable. But the way things are right now, he's the fifth outfielder, coming off knee surgery. We have Vlad [Guerrero], Torii [Hunter], Bobby Abreu and Juan Rivera, and those are four good players. Gary needs to focus on getting completely healthy and contributing when he can."

Matthews, who has a full no-trade clause in his contract this season, would be owed a $500,000 assignment fee if dealt.

Matthews has said he would be more than open to a trade to a club that could use him on a regular basis, especially as a center fielder. He has three years left on a deal he signed after his 2006 All-Star season with Texas -- $10 million this season, $11 million in 2010 and $12 million in 2012.

"As of today," Reagins said, "he's going to be an extra outfielder. We gave him an update on his status. We were very forthright, but the details of the meeting will remain behind closed doors."

Matthews changed into street clothes and left the facility, the team granting him permission to take the day off.

Matthews said he needed some time to "think things over." After undergoing left knee surgery in late October, he "worked his butt off" this winter, according to Scioscia, and is in the midst of a strong spring, batting .258 with two homers, two doubles and a triple in 31 at-bats.
