Garret Anderson, who was one of a few current free agents to represent himself, has changed his mind and hired Scott Boras as his agent.



Anderson became a free agent for the first time in his 15-year career after the Angels bought out his contract for $3 million instead of picking up his $14 million option for the 2009 season.



Anderson, 36, originally signed a four-year, $48 million contract extension with the Angels in 2004, when Chris Arnold as his agent.



The Angels, who haven't ruled out re-signing Anderson, may be dealing with Boras a lot this offseason, as he is also the agent for Mark Teixeira, the club's most sought-after free agent.



Anderson, though, is now free to test the market for the first time in his career. He made it clear during the season that he wants to play every day, and though he played in 145 games last season, he said he didn't like taking days off.



The franchise leader in games, hits, runs, doubles, total bases and RBIs, Anderson had another solid season in 2008, hitting .293 with 15 home runs and 84 RBIs.
