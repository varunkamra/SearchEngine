Whether batting at the top of the order or the cleanup spot, from the right side of the batter's box or the left, Angels center fielder Gary Matthews Jr. has proven that he is adept at wearing down opposing pitchers.

Twins reliever Jason Miller, a victim of the switch-hitter's  bat in a 16-3 loss to the Halos on Monday, surrendered an eighth-inning grand slam to Matthews Jr. The towering blast to right-center field highlighted a four-hit, five-RBI night that raised the outfielder's average 12 points. Miller allowed seven hits and eight runs in the inning, ballooning his ERA to a 18.00.

Matthews Jr. merely added an exclamation point to a 23-hit performance by a Halos offense that is outscoring opponents in the first inning 64-27, with a 186-135 advantage in the first five innings.

What is the source of Matthews' success?

"Probably opportunity," said Matthews Jr. "Reggie's done a great job of getting on base, and Cabrera played extremely well. He's been on fire for us. ... No doubt, it's definitely a lot easier when everybody's hitting. They always say in baseball, hitting's contagious. It really seems like it is. It really seems to build confidence when you have guys hitting. It sort of makes guys take it to another level."



Pitching matchup
LAA: RHP John Lackey (9-3, 2.37 ERA)
Lackey is fresh off his Major League-leading ninth win after getting a 3-2 decision over the Orioles Friday. Lackey, the winning pitcher in Game 7 of the 2002 World Series, is simply overpowering, with great command of his pitches and good movement on his two-seam fastball. He picked up the first postseason victory of his career against the Twins in Game 4 of the ALCS during the Angels' 2002 title run. He has not lost since May 5.


MIN: RHP Kevin Slowey (0-0, 1.50 ERA)
A well-rounded mix of pitches allowed Slowey to deliver a solid Major League debut against the A's. Slowey gave up just one run on five hits over six innings in a no-decision. Some tough at-bats drove Slowey' pitch count up early in the outing and he did face some jams. But Slowey's presence on the mound was the biggest thing the club took from his first start.

Player to watch
Rookie outfielder Reggie Willits matched a career-best with three hits against Minnesota on Monday, marking his fourth three-hit effort this season. A speedy and agressive baserunner, Willits has also scored 15 runs in his last 16 games.
