The Angels took care of one piece of business Monday when they agreed to terms with outfielder Jeff DaVanon on a one-year, $950,000 contract and avoided arbitration.

They still have to settle contracts with arbitration-eligible starter Jarrod Washburn, reliever Scot Shields and catchers Jose Molina and Josh Paul. If contracts aren't agreed upon, the team will exchange salary proposals with the players Tuesday and will wait for arbitration hearings in February.

DaVanon, 31, played in 108 games for the Angels in 2004, hitting .277 with seven home runs, 34 RBIs and a career-high 18 stolen bases. He had a career year in 2003, batting .282 with 12 homers and 43 RBIs.

DaVanon's contract is full of incentives based on playing time. The switch-hitter -- who is slated for a reserve outfield role -- can earn an additional $30,000 if he has 350 plate appearances or plays in 110 games, another $25,000 if he has 400 plate appearances or plays in 120 games, and $20,000 more if he has 450 plate appearances or plays in 130 games.

DaVanon earned $375,000 last season after missing arbitration eligibility by a few days of service time.
