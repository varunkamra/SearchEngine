ANAHEIM -- Angels manager Mike Scioscia gave outfielder Torii Hunter the day off Sunday in the series finale against the Mariners in hopes of giving a little extra rest to a toe injury he suffered on April 12 at Seattle.

"Torii wants to play, but we want to take advantage of the [off-day Monday]," Scioscia said. "His toe is feeling better. It's just that when you project how much Torii is going to play in the season, we want to take advantage -- yesterday he DH'd, today off, tomorrow off -- and hopefully get this toe thing taken care of. It is manageable for now, but we want to get it as far behind him as we can, to where it won't become an issue."

The injury is to the big toe on Hunter's left foot. Scioscia said the day off had nothing to do with any lingering effects from a car accident that Hunter was involved in just outside of Angel Stadium before Friday's game.

Neither the toe injury nor the car accident has seemed to slow the center fielder down. He was 4-for-8 with three RBIs in the series with Seattle coming into Sunday, and five of his last six hits have been doubles. He's hitting .338 so far this season.

The Angels hope Hunter will pick up right where he left off in the Seattle series. With the off-day on Monday, the Angels start a three-game series at Boston on Tuesday.
