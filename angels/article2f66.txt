PHILADELPHIA -- The Phillies came into their Interleague series vs. the Angels with a total of 59 homers from their 3-4-5 hitters -- Chase Utley, Ryan Howard and Pat Burrell. That was only two fewer than the entire Angels team had put together through 73 games.

"I'd like to take some of their home runs," Angels manager Mike Scioscia said with a grin. "They have as much power through their lineup as anybody. I don't care if they say, 'In this ballpark, the ball flies.' [The Phillies] have legitimate power."

Vladimir Guerrero, who has been known to make large parks look small, wasted no time on Friday night making himself at home at Citizens Bank Park. The first pitch he saw from Adam Eaton was sent rocketing into the seats in left field for Guerrero's 11th homer of the season -- half as many as Utley.





Guerrero has made a habit of tormenting the Phillies, dating to his days with the Expos. His 29 homers and 81 RBIs against Philadelphia are his best career totals against any club.

Studying the layout of the park before the game, the Angels' hitters experienced an unmistakable case of love at first sight. For the pitchers, on the other hand, it was another sensation altogether.

"Maybe I'll elevate one," Chone Figgins said, grinning. He did, too, almost finding the range in the right-field corner for what would have been his first homer before watching it hook foul. He singled a moment later, scoring on Garret Anderson's second hit of the night. In the fourth, Figgins sent right fielder Geoff Jenkins to the track for an out.

"It's a good place to hit, you can see that," Anderson said. "But you still have to get your pitch and hit it."

The absence of a designated hitter in the National League park cost Gary Matthews Jr. a chance to play with his father, Gary "Sarge" Matthews, announcing from a Phillies broadcast booth.

Matthews has found his rhythm at the plate, batting .310 during the nine-game homestand, but Scioscia had Anderson and Guerrero in the outfield with Torii Hunter -- and it paid off with all three cranking out early hits to jump-start the offense.

Scioscia has been waiting for his long-dormant attack to roll into high gear, and there are signs it might be happening. The Angels scored 16 runs in three games against the Mets before leaving home, reaching six runs in a game twice after they'd done that only once in the previous 24 games.

"We think our lineup's going to get deeper as we get into it," Scioscia said. "Our batter's box offense has been sluggish. They're a little deeper than us offensively, but we have a lineup that can get deeper as guys swing better."

No time like the present to start.




Pitching matchup
LAA: LHP Joe Saunders (10-3, 3.06 ERA)
Saunders bounced back from his worst start of the season to blank the Braves for 7 1/3 innings on Sunday. He mixed his 91-93-mph fastball with a nasty sinker to allow just five hits while striking out five and walking two. He became the third American League pitcher to win 10 games. Saunders has never pitched against the Phillies, but carries a 5-1 record with a 1.77 ERA on the road.




PHI: RHP Brett Myers (3-8, 5.58 ERA)
Myers' 3-8 start to 2008 is his worst in seven Major League seasons. At times this season, the Phils' Opening Day starter has pitched effectively and kept his team in games. But that wasn't the case against the Cardinals on Sunday, when Myers imploded for six runs in six innings, allowing two home runs to increase his league-leading total to 20. In one career start against the Angels in 2003, Myers lasted 5 2/3 innings, allowing five runs and taking the loss.
