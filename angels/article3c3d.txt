SARASOTA, Fla. -- What's that old cliche that gets trotted out every spring? Something about hope springing eternal? 

Spring Training is that time of year for boundless optimism, where everything still seems possible. While that's true to an extent, it's not wholly accurate, not for everybody.

Every spring, there are players who get invited to big league camp -- some who get plenty of playing time  -- and put up really good numbers. But these are Minor League veterans, guys who have very little shot at making a 25-man roster. Sure, there are exceptions, guys who buck the odds and make a team after years of toiling in the Minors. 



And this year might be a good year for it, a spring that other Minor Leaguers can point to and rely on for inspiration as they try to fulfill their dreams. They can look at 26-year-old Casey McGehee, who was claimed by the Brewers off waivers from the Cubs and proceeded to tear up the Cactus League to the tune of a .370 average, six homers, 15 RBIs and a .722 slugging percentage in 54 at-bats. He's made the team as a utilityman, earning the job over the "established" Mike Lamb.

Or they can all cling to the story of Chris Carter, who spent three seasons in Triple-A before making his big league debut last year. The 26-year-old, who has a career .308 average and .519 slugging percentage in the Minors, has hit .359 with six homers in 65 at-bats this spring to claim the last spot on the Red Sox roster. It's that kind of tale that might inspire the others on this list. 

Matt Brown, 3B, Angels: He had a huge 2008 during which he played in the Olympics and got up to the Major Leagues for 11 games. The 26-year-old has batted .500 this spring, including a six-hit game, with 17 RBIs over 42 at-bats. That might be a slam dunk on other teams, but Brown has two players in front of him at third and at first, and the corner outfield spots he can play are also jam-packed. He's still in camp, so there's a chance, but it's a slim one.

Jake Fox, Bobby Scales, Cubs: A pair of Cubbies who certainly performed but got sent down on March 24. Fox, 26, made a brief appearance in the bigs in 2007 and hit .350 with four homers and 16 RBIs over 60 at-bats this spring. He's closing in on 600 games played in the Minor Leagues, where he's hit .285 with a .505 SLG. Of course, he's got nothing on Scales, who is 31 and will play in his 1,000th Minor League game in 2009. Compare that with the zero big league games he's played in, despite the .285 average (.320 in 2008, the sixth season he's seen time at Triple-A), .376 on-base percentage and ability to play just about every position on the field. Hitting .333 in 42 spring ABs wasn't enough as he was sent back for another year of Pacific Coast League action. 

Jesus Guzman, 3B, Giants: He's only 24, so maybe he doesn't belong on this list, but he did sign back in 2000. The infielder spent three years in the Venezuelan Summer League before finally coming to the United States. He's twice signed with teams as a Minor League free agent, and the Giants are his third team in as many years. But all he does is rake. He hit .349 in 2008 with a .948 OPS. Then he was the Venezuelan Winter League MVP after hitting .349 with a 1.051 OPS. This spring? How about a .412 average, five homers and 15 RBIs in 51 at-bats? Too bad he doesn't have a true position, because I think that bat is ready. It's why he stuck around in camp until Tuesday.

Jason Lane, OF, Blue Jays: Once upon a time, Lane was an established big leaguer, one who hit 26 homers back in 2005. I'm not sure what's happened since, but he's spent most of the past two years in Triple-A and he's hit .286 with 124 homers and .508 slugging percentage as a Minor Leaguer. He batted .358 with five homers and 12 RBIs in 53 ABs this spring for Toronto, but it wasn't enough to win a job over Kevin Millar. Can't someone use a right-handed platoon guy with pop? 

Garrett Jones, OF/1B, Pirates: Maybe he and Lane should package themselves as a perfect platoon. The lefty has always had power, with four Minor League seasons of 20 homers or more. Last year, his fourth at Triple-A Rochester, was his best as he finished first or second in the International League in a host of offensive categories. This spring with a new team, the 27-year-old has hit .294 with four homers and 11 RBIs in 51 at-bats. He's still in big league camp, but there's really no place to put him.

Darnell McDonald, OF, Reds: I've seen quite a bit of him as I've covered the Reds here in Florida for the past week and a half. And boy, has he been impressive, both offensively and defensively. Manager Dusty Baker has gone out of his way to praise the former first-round pick a number of times. He's hit .311 in 45 ABs and stolen three bases while outlasting guys like Norris Hopper and Jacque Jones. If he were a left-handed hitter, he'd have a better chance. Instead, the 30-year-old will probably head down to Triple-A to add to his 4,800-plus at-bats.

Andres Torres, OF, Giants: Hold onto your hats, folks, because Torres is still in the middle of a competition for a big league job. That's right, the 31-year-old with 89 Major League games and more than 1,000 in the Minors could stick as the Giants' fifth outfielder. Speed is still his calling card: he has 311 career steals in the Minors, including 29 last year. This spring, he's swiped five more bags while hitting .397 in 63 at-bats . In a twist, his age might work to his advantage because there might not be enough playing time to keep the younger Eugenio Velez in San Francisco.

Jon Weber, OF, Rays: One of my favorites, I must admit, among the Minor League vet set, Weber just goes about his business in a lunch pail kind of way -- hits and wins wherever he goes.  A non-drafted free agent, he's hit .288 in a career that's spanned 966 games. This spring, he's batted .333 with three homers and 14 RBIs in 39 at-bats, and it's a shame the 31-year-old won't get a real look as a professional lefty hitter coming off the bench in Tampa.
