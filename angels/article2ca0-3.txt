OAKLAND -- Chone Figgins sits at his locker every day, waiting for the reporters to come check in, and he usually has nothing new to offer. Hamstrings take time to heal, and that is complicated when pain surfaces in another area near the hammy.

Before Saturday night's game against the A's, manager Mike Scioscia finally delivered a fresh update. 

There's a good chance Figgins will begin to play Minor League rehab games for Triple-A Salt Lake on Monday.

"Figgy worked out early today," Scioscia said. "He ran the bases, did different workouts. He feels good. If he comes out of it OK, he'll be ready for a rehab assignment on Monday. Izzy will go to Salt Lake."

Figgins might have preferred playing closer to home, with the Angels opening a homestand Monday night against the Rays, but Class A Rancho Cucamonga is on the road, at Lancaster. That made Salt Lake a preferable option, Scioscia said.

"It feels good," Figgins said. "I'm close to getting back out there and playing some baseball again. I just want to get back with my team. It's been awhile."

Figgins has played one game -- May 21 in Toronto -- since injuring his right hamstring sliding into home plate against the Orioles on May 3. In that game against the Blue Jays, he aggravated the area near the hamstring, on the outside of the knee, chasing a popup on the Rogers Centre carpet.

Figgins, a Georgia native who closely follows all sports endeavors by his native teams, hopes to be back in the lineup when the Braves come to Angel Stadium on Friday for the first of three Interleague Play dates. He won't even mind that it's Friday the 13th.
