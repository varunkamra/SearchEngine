ANAHEIM -- The Tampa Bay Rays' success this season has left many people surprised, but not Angels manager Mike Scioscia.



And it isn't just because of Scioscia's relationship with Rays manager Joe Maddon, who spent 31 years in the Angels organization and served as bench coach under Scioscia for six seasons (2000-2005). 



Scioscia said it was just a matter of time before the Rays would find success with all their young talent.



"You could see it brewing," Scioscia said. "Those guys have some young players that are extremely talented. Guys like Carl Crawford and B.J. Upton playing like veterans, and pitchers like Scott Kazmir, who's been around enough and is gonna be a force."



Scioscia said the Rays' turnaround from their American League-worst 66-96 record last season is largely due to their pitching. The Rays' team ERA this season was 3.88 entering Monday, a far cry from their league-worst 5.53 ERA last season.



"I think they turned it around with how they pitched," Scioscia said. "You can see that their young talent there is a good foundation. They've pitched well and that's why it turned around so quick."



The biggest improvement has been the bullpen, which has made a complete 180 from last season, when it posted a horrendous 6.16 ERA. This season, the Rays' relievers had a respectable 3.55 ERA through Sunday, good for the 10th-best mark in baseball.



"They have some good roles in their bullpen," Scioscia said. "They've been able to hold leads."


The Rays have one of the youngest staffs in baseball, as their oldest starting pitcher is James Shields, who is 26 years old. The Angels and 25-year-old starter Jered Weaver face Shields on Tuesday in a battle between youthful pitchers.






Pitching matchup
LAA: RHP Jered Weaver (5-6, 4.79 ERA)
Weaver picked up his fifth win of the season Wednesday in Seattle when he pitched six innings, giving up four runs on 10 hits. He's hasn't pitched his best lately, but has still earned the win in three of his last four starts. He has pitched much better at home this season, posting a 3.47 ERA at Angel Stadium compared to a 5.98 ERA on the road. Weaver is 1-0 with a 3.00 ERA in one career start against the Rays.


TB: RHP James Shields (4-4, 3.64 ERA)
Shields was ejected in the second inning of his start on Thursday, when he hit Boston's Coco Crisp with a pitch that led to a bench-clearing fracas. Shields gave up four earned runs, including a home run to Manny Ramirez, before plunking Crisp with no outs. Shields hasn't won a start since May 9, when he threw a complete-game shutout against the Angels. He is 3-1 with a 2.62 ERA in five career starts against the Angels.
