As Angels fans prepare for their journey to the desert, here are some questions and answers that should help fans catch their favorite club in person this spring:

When do the Angels arrive at camp?
The Angels' pitchers and catchers report to Spring Training on Feb. 15, with the position players following on Feb. 20. The first full-squad workout is Feb. 21.

When do games start?
The Angels' Cactus League slate gets under way on March 1 with a 12:05 p.m. PT meeting with the Royals at Tempe Diablo Stadium.

After their March 28 game in Phoenix against the A's, the Angels head back home to Southern California for a pair of games against the rival Dodgers on March 29 and 30 and the exhibition season finale March 31 at Angel Stadium.

How do I get tickets?
Tickets for all Angels Spring Training games at Tempe Diablo Stadium can be purchased at angelsbaseball.com or by calling Ticketmaster. Tickets will go on sale at the Tempe Diablo Stadium box office on Feb. 16.

Tempe Diablo Stadium holds 9,315 fans, including about 2,000 on the berm beyond the left-field fence -- always a popular spot for families. The stadium also has some seating in the shade, as well as fully stocked concession stands on the concourse located on the entry level of the park.

Ticket prices and other information can be found at the Angels' Spring Training Tickets page.

Where is Tempe, and how do I get there?
If you're coming from the Southland, you actually have a couple of options. If you have the time, you can make the drive of six hours or so to the Valley of the Sun. But there are also non-stop flights of about one hour to Phoenix from Orange County, LAX and Ontario through several airlines, so that's the preferred method for most.

The Angels' complex is located just minutes away from Sky Harbor Airport, on West Alameda Drive between S. 48th Street and I-10, just off Broadway Road.

How can I watch the team work out?
There is no admission to see the Angels work out on their fields adjacent to Tempe Diablo Stadium. The Major Leaguers will be there all spring long, while the Minor Leaguers will report in early March to work out on the new Minor League fields that have been added to the complex.

Before the start of the Cactus League schedule, the Major League team hits the field around 9 a.m., and some hitters stay out there well into the afternoon.

Where can I get some autographs?
If they're finished with their work for the day, you might catch players heading back to the clubhouse through the main stadium parking lot. You can also catch players as they enter and exit the parking lot behind the right-field fence. Once games start, the seats down the right-field line are a prime autograph spot.

What else is there to do in Tempe?
Located in the heart of the Valley of the Sun, Tempe has its own nightlife, most of it in the area surrounding Arizona State University. But it's also very close to Scottsdale, which includes the Valley's hottest hot spots as well as restaurants and Old West history. There isn't a more central location in the Valley for anything you'd want to do than Tempe.

When do the Angels open the regular season?
On April 2, the Angels begin their quest for an American League West title with an Opening Night matchup with the Rangers at Angel Stadium.
