Angels southpaw Joe Saunders has been inside Oakland's McAfee Coliseum, but he's never pitched there -- until now.

"I'm looking forward to it," he said of his rematch with Chad Gaudin that kicks off a four-game series with the A's. "It's another opportunity for me to help the ballclub. That's what I'm here for."

Saunders and Gaudin faced off on April 5 in Anaheim, but neither figured in a 4-3 decision claimed by Oakland. That was the only Saunders start the Angels have lost, taking the next six. He hasn't given up more than four earned runs in any of his outings, and that happened only once.

Rumored to be part of a proposed deal for Texas' Mark Teixeira before the slugger was sent to Atlanta, Saunders has been an important part of the Angels' success even as a part-timer, shuffling between Triple-A Salt Lake and the Majors.

"It's nice to know the team feels confident in you to go out and do the job," Saunders said. "Guys here are happy to be here and would like to stay. We're right there, in first place. This is a great club to play for."

Though his linescore against Detroit in his last start was less than overwhelming -- the southpaw went 5 1/3 innings, allowing three runs on eight hits -- Saunders put in another quality outing that further cemented his status as a quality Major League starter.

His only blemish came in the form of a two-run blast by Magglio Ordonez. Saunders pitched four scoreless innings and remained undefeated through seven starts despite getting a no-decision. The talented lefty continues to develop a knack for pitching himself out of tough jams while keeping his team in the game.

Gaudin is facing the Angels for the fourth time this season. His first start of the year was the five-inning no-decision against Saunders, giving up two earned runs. He beat the Angels on April 17 in Oakland, giving up one earned run in 7 2/3 innings of a 4-1 win. On July 23, he lasted only 3 2/3 innings in a 12-6 A's victory, yielding five earned runs on six hits and six walks.

Gaudin's most recent outing was more substantial. He had one bad inning -- a three-run second -- against the Mariners, but overall he was quite effective. Gaudin went eight innings, allowing just four hits and four runs in a 4-3 loss.
