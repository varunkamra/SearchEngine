The Angels are making their seventh postseason appearance in the franchise's 46 years of existence after winning their third American League West title in the past four years. The Angels wrapped up the division in Anaheim, a week before the end of the season with a 7-4 victory over the Mariners. 

The Angels won the World Series in 2002, but they didn't advance to the Fall Classic in '04, after getting swept by the Red Sox in the AL Division Series, or in 2005, losing in five games to the eventual World Series champion White Sox in the AL Championship Series.


TEAM RECORD

Overall: 94-68
Home: 54-27
Road: 40-41
Day: 30-23
Night: 64-45
By month: April 15-11, May 18-11, June 17-9, July 12-12, Aug. 18-11 and Sept. 14-14



The Angels have taken advantage of playing at home this season, posting the best home record in the Majors and hitting an AL-best .305 at Angel Stadium. The pitching has also been better at home -- a 3.85 ERA compared to a 4.65 road ERA.


HITTING

Team Stats
Avg.: .285, 4th in AL
Runs: 822, 4th in AL
HRs: 121, 12th in AL
OPS: .762, 7th in AL

The Angels hit for a high average and drove in runs with extra-base hits, not relying solely on the home run this season. The Halos also enter the postseason swinging the bat well, hitting .286 and scoring 4.9 runs per game in September.


Individual Leaders
(Qualifiers only)
Avg.: Chone Figgins, .330, T-9th
HRs: Vladimir Guerrero, 27, T-34th
RBIs: Guerrero, 125, 5th
Runs: Orlando Cabrera, 101, T-24th
OPS: Guerrero, .950, 17th
SB: Figgins, 41, 7th


Guerrero had another All-Star year at the plate, and Figgins was one of the top hitters in the Majors all season long. Lately, though, Garret Anderson has provided a spark, hitting .361 in his last 28 games heading into the postseason.


PITCHING

Team Stats
Overall ERA: 4.23, T-11th
Starters ERA: 4.24, 4th in AL
Bullpen ERA: 4.22, 8th in AL
Strikeouts: 1,152, 26th
HRs allowed: 150, 8th
Opponents BA: .328, 9th


The Angels starters have not only been effective, but they've gone deep into ballgames. The Angels' bullpen was one of the least used in the AL, so it should be fresh heading into the postseason. Closer Francisco Rodriguez had another All-Star year, converting 40 out of 46 save opportunities.


Individual Leaders
Wins: John Lackey 19, T-2nd
ERA (starter): Lackey 3.01, T-2nd
ERA (reliever): Rodriguez, 2.81
Strikeouts: Lackey, 179, 17th
Saves: Rodriguez, 40, T-5th
Holds: Scot Shields, 31, T-6th 
HRs allowed: Ervin Santana, 26, T-20th
Opponents BA: Kelvim Escobar, .248, T-22nd


When Lackey or Escobar started, the Angels were 46-17 this season. It's the first time since 1991 that the Angels had two 18-game winners. The bullpen has been solid with Shields, Rodriguez and Darren Oliver -- the left-hander has a 2.00 ERA since the All-Star break, and he hasn't allowed an earned run in 35 of his last 41 outings.


FIELDING

Team
Fielding percentage: .983, 17th
Errors: 100, 14th

The Angels are -- statistically -- the worst fielding AL playoff team. Even worse, however, is that the Angels might be without Gary Matthews and Guerrero in the outfield when the playoffs start.


Top individuals
1B Casey Kotchman, .997, 4th in AL
SS Cabrera, .983, 1st in AL


While the Angels as a club aren't a great fielding team, Kotchman and Cabrera have played well. Kotchman continues to be one of the top, young defensive first basemen in the league, committing just three errors this season. Cabrera's 11 errors were the least by a qualifying AL shortstop this season.


ANGELS VS. RED SOX

Record: 4-6


Game by game
April 13: Angels 1, Red Sox 10 -- Lackey loses first game of season

April 14: Angels 0, Red Sox 8 -- Boston's Schilling shuts down Angels 

April 16: Angels 2, Red Sox 7 --Angels swept by Boston; Guerrero leaves early

Aug. 6: Red Sox 2, Angels 4 --Young players step up for Halos 

Aug. 7: Red Sox 4, Angels 10 -- Matthews four-RBI night leads Angels past Sox

Aug. 8: Red Sox 9, Angels 6 -- Boston's bullpen shuts down Halos

Aug. 17: Angels 4, Red Sox 8 -- Lackey struggles early, Angels lose

Aug. 17: Angels 7, Red Sox 5 -- Guerrero's big night wins it

Aug. 18: Angels 5, Red Sox 10 --Ortiz's grand slam carries Red Sox


Aug. 19: Angels 3, Red Sox 1 -- Saunders sharp in Halos win


Fenway Park didn't treat the Angels well this season, as they went 2-5 in Boston. Historically, it's always been that way, as the Angels have a .404 winning percentage there. A bigger concern, though, is Lackey, who is 0-2 with an 8.38 ERA in two starts against the Red Sox this season. The Angels have faced the Red Sox twice in the postseason, losing a seven-game series in 1986 and being swept in '04. 

ANGELS VS. POSTSEASON TEAMS

vs. Indians: 5-5
vs. Yankees:  6-3
vs. D-backs:  -
vs. Cubs:  -
vs. Phillies:  -
vs. Rockies:  -
vs. Padres:  -


The Angels were 4-3 at home and 1-2 on the road against the Indians. The Angels swept the Yankees in May at Yankee Stadium. In the final six games against New York, the Angels split the three games on the road and at home. The Angels did not face any of the National League postseason teams during Interleague Play.


POSTSEASON EXPERIENCE


Lackey (8 G [6 GS], 2-1, 3.26 ERA)
Escobar (7 G [1 GS], 1-2, 3.07 ERA)
Bartolo Colon (9 G [9 GS], 2-3, 3.61 ERA)
Rodriguez (18 G, 5-3, 2.17 ERA, 3 SV)
Santana (2 G [1 GS], 1-1, 7.45 ERA)
Shields (11 G, 1-1, 2.87 ERA)
Oliver (3 G, 1-0, 3.52 ERA)
Guerrero (.180, 1 HR, 7 RBI, .241 OBP)
Anderson (.261, 5 HR, 22 RBI, .437 SLG)
Figgins (.151, 0 HR, 3 RBI, 3 SB)
Cabrera (.260, 1 HR, 17 RBI, .318 OBP)
Kotchman (.200, 0 HR, 1 RBI)
Robb Quinlan (.400, 1 HR, 1 RBI)
Juan Rivera (.259, 1 HR, 5 RBI)


The Angels have several players with postseason experience this season. That might not be too big of a factor, considering that they won it all in 2002 with nobody on the roster with playoff experience. Lackey was the winning pitcher in Game 7 of the 2002 World Series, becoming the second rookie pitcher to win a finale.
