Paul Byrd has not enjoyed himself on the mound through his first five starts this season, with the exception of one night a couple of weeks back.

In that start, Byrd breezed through eight innings and allowed one run to the Mariners, who managed 11 hits but could not further capitalize. Byrd did not walk a batter that evening and struck out three to pick up his lone win of the season.

Byrd gets another shot at the Mariners on Wednesday and will be looking to find command of his sinker and cutter to help him vary the tempo of the game.

Taking the hill for the Mariners will be Aaron Sele. The former Angels right-hander struggled in his start against his old club on the same night Byrd put it together. Sele allowed six runs on eight hits over four innings.
