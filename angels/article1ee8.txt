TEMPE, Ariz. -- Jon Garland is accustomed to flying under the radar. It has something to do with radar gun readings and a lot to do with perception.

"I think in people's eyes, they like the home-run hitters, and they like the big strikeout pitchers," Garland, the Angels' new starter, was saying. "That's not me by any means.

"I wouldn't say I'm overlooked, but at the same time I've noticed that over the years, the power pitchers get most of the attention. I think I've done a great job for my team. That's what matters to me."

While Garland was arriving in Angels camp decidedly under the radar, the acquisition of strikeout artist Erik Bedard by American League West rival Seattle came with major fanfare.

The Mariners sent left-handed reliever George Sherrill and four prospects -- including touted outfielder Adam Jones -- to the Orioles for Bedard, while the Angels parted with shortstop Orlando Cabrera in landing Garland.

Bedard, six months older than Garland, is guaranteed to be with the Mariners for two more years, while Garland is eligible for free agency after the season.

While Bedard has been racking up dazzling strikeout numbers in Baltimore, the Canadian southpaw hasn't won more than 15 games or thrown as many as 200 innings in a season.

Garland, by contrast, has averaged fewer than four strikeouts per nine innings while twice winning 18 games (2005 and 2006) and delivering more than 200 innings each of the past four seasons.

John Lackey, a keen student of the craft, sees a correlation in those comparative numbers.

"Jon's got that nasty sinker that gets him a lot of early-count outs," said Lackey, a 19-game winner and American League ERA kingpin in 2007. "That gets him deeper in games. I've learned the value of doing that, to not going for the strikeout as much. You're saving bullets. Quick, easy outs, that's the way to go.

"When you get a guy like Jon going over 200 innings every year, you're obviously doing your job. The manager wouldn't leave you out there if you weren't.

"He's a great addition to out staff, to our team. He's won 18 games two years in a row -- that's a pretty elite class for a pitcher."

Garland, 28, he has won 92 Major League games compared to 40 by Bedard, the Mariners' late-blooming ace.

When Kelvim Escobar's shoulder mends and he assumes his spot in the Angels' rotation, the matchups between the AL West rivals will be fascinating: 1. Lackey vs. Bedard; 2. Escobar vs. Felix Hernandez; 3. Garland vs. Carlos Silva; 4. Jered Weaver vs. Miguel Batista; 5. Ervin Santana or Joe Saunders vs. Jarrod Washburn.

Angels manager Mike Scioscia habitually refrains from discussing other clubs' moves and players this time of year, but he doesn't mind assessing Garland's impact on his outfit.

"Jon's value is that he's an outstanding pitcher who has proven he can win, and win big," Scioscia said. "He's pitched in big games. He not only gives you innings, he gives you good innings.

"This guy's terrific. Outside of his won-loss numbers last year, he's pitched well."

Falling to 10-13 in 2007 with a White Sox club that labored offensively and in the field, Garland was made available. New Angels GM Tony Reagins snapped him up at the expense of one of their most valuable everyday players, Cabrera.

Scioscia has been a Garland fan for a long time. The skipper hasn't forgotten how the 6-foot-6 right-hander carved up his Angels in a series-turning Game 3 of the 2005 ALCS at Angel Stadium.

Outdueling Lackey, 5-2, Garland's win put the White Sox ahead in the series. Garland threw 83 strikes among 118 pitches, giving up four hits and one walk while striking out seven men. The only runs he allowed came on a two-run homer by Cabrera.

The White Sox didn't lose another game on their way to a World Series sweep of the Astros.

Working Game 3 of the World Series in Houston, Garland went seven innings, yielding two earned runs. He didn't factor in the decision -- the White Sox won in 14 innings on Geoff Blum's homer -- but he kept his team in the game.

In 16 postseason innings, Garland surrendered 11 hits, three walks and four earned runs for a 2.25 ERA.

"That's something I feel good about," Garland said. Clearly, pressure doesn't bother this guy.

His postseason debut, the decision over the Angels, "hasn't come up yet," Garland said, grinning, on Friday morning as he was greeted by new teammates and pitching coach Mike Butcher. "I'm sure I've rubbed some of the guys wrong over the years, but I hope they don't hold it against me."

Lackey doesn't see that happening.

"From watching him across the field," Lackey said, "I really like his demeanor. He's even-keel; he doesn't get too high or too low."

He'll keep his team involved when he's on the mound, throwing strikes, even if he doesn't need three of them to get outs.

"Why wouldn't you want early outs?" Garland said. "You want them to swing the bat on the first pitch. The [fewer] pitches you throw, it definitely helps you get deeper in games.

"Earlier in my career, I really wasn't like that. I was trying to find myself. I use my team now."

In doing so, Garland is the type of pitcher who spares a bullpen. That's another major benefit, in Scioscia's eyes.

"Your starting rotation needs to get to a certain point in games," the manager said. "You need them to get 18, 19, 20 outs, the occasional complete game and 24-out game. If you're only getting 15, 17 outs from them, it's exacting a great toll on the bullpen.

"Jon is going to pitch deep in games, and he's going to be effective, much like what we've seen from John Lackey. We'd like our young pitchers -- Weaver, Saunders, Santana -- to get that consistent length, and we think they will.

"John Lackey and Jon garland are two guys who have proven they can get deep in games on a consistent basis. That's important to your pitching staff."

If it means flying under the radar to get there, Garland doesn't seem to mind.
