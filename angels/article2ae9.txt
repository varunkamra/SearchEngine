ANAHEIM -- Angels manager Mike Scioscia will get a chance to go back to his roots on Friday, when the Angels travel to Philadelphia to open a three-game series against the Phillies.



Scioscia, who was born in Upper Darby, Pa., and went to high school in nearby Springfield, Pa., grew up rooting for the hometown Phillies at the now-demolished Veterans Stadium.





"I probably used to go to like 10 games a year," said Scioscia, who will spend time visiting friends and family over the weekend. "We'd sit all the way up in general admission and then sneak down, only the Philadelphia way. It used to be only 50 cents to sit up top. But by the fourth inning, we'd be right down there by the right-field line."



Scioscia will get a much better view on Friday, but it'll be at Citizens Bank Park, a place where the Angels have never played before.



It won't be the only new thing for the Angels either, as it will be the first time this season that the Halos pitchers will bat.



And, according to Scioscia, it won't be very pretty.



"We don't have a best-hitting pitcher," Scioscia said. "It's like saying, 'What's the best punishment?' It's more like the least worst-hitting pitcher."



The honorable title of the least worst-hitting pitcher actually goes to reliever Darren Oliver, who carries a career .221 batting average in 217 career at-bats when he was a National League starting pitcher. But the combined career batting average for the five Angels starters is .130 (6-for-46).



The Angels' pitching staff has been taking early batting practice at Angel Stadium in the past week in preparation for its nine-game NL road trip. But batting against live pitching is a different story.



"It gives you a good idea of what your swing is going to be like, but until you get in there against 90-mph pitches, it's a little different," said right-hander Jered Weaver, who is 1-for-4 in his career. "It's all luck when you get in there. If you haven't done in the past six or seven years or on a consistent basis, it's pretty much you're either a good hitter or getting lucky."



The Angels will need to be extra cautious after seeing the Yankees' Chien-Ming Wang injuring himself running the bases and the Red Sox's Bartolo Colon hurting himself while swinging.



"What you worry about is what happened to Bartolo Colon, where you swing and hurt something," Scioscia said. "Hopefully, we're past that point because they've taken enough reps."



The Angels pitchers, however, haven't done any baserunning drills, and they are just hoping nothing bad happens on the basepaths.



"It's something your body is not used to doing," Weaver said. "You're running around the bases, and American League pitchers aren't used to doing that, so it throws your body out of whack. You can obviously get injured, so we're hoping nothing happens on our end."



Right-hander Ervin Santana will try his luck against Phillies starter Adam Eaton in the first game of the series on Friday.






Pitching matchup
LAA: RHP Ervin Santana (8-3, 3.40 ERA)
Santana cruised through the first four innings against the Braves on Saturday, but he ran into trouble in both the fifth and six innings. He lasted 5 2/3 innings, allowing six earned runs on nine hits, including solo home runs to Brandon Jones and Kelly Johnson. He didn't pitch at least six innings for only the second time this season, picking up his third loss. Santana has never faced the Phillies, but he is 5-1 with a 3.50 ERA on the road this season.


PHI: RHP Adam Eaton (2-4, 4.57 ERA)
Eaton enters Friday's game with a string of five consecutive quality starts. He went 6 2/3 innings against St. Louis on Saturday and allowed just three runs. The big issue for Eaton is getting out of the first inning without surrendering a home run. In each of his past two starts, Eaton has given up a first-inning homer (Mark Teixeira and Adam Kennedy) before settling down and pitching effectively.

Tidbits
Angels right-hander Kelvim Escobar and reliever Chris Bootcheck are en route to Tempe, Ariz., to continue their rehab stints for their injuries. Escobar, who was diagnosed with a torn labrum in late March, will throw a simulated game on Tuesday, and he could pitch two innings in an Arizona Summer League game next week. Bootcheck, who is on the 15-day disabled list with a strained forearm, is expected to begin a long-toss program this weekend. ... Three-time Olympic gold medalist swimmer Amanda Beard threw out the first pitch at Angel Stadium on Wednesday.
