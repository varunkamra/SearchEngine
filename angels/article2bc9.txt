ANAHEIM -- The Angels will send Jon Garland to the hill in Thursday's series final with the White Sox, and introductions will not be necessary.

The veteran right-hander spent parts of seven seasons in Chicago before coming to the Angels in an offseason trade that sent shortstop Orlando Cabrera to the White Sox. 

Garland tossed a memorable game at Angel Stadium in a matchup between these two teams in the 2005 American League Championship Series, when he went the distance and allowed two runs to pick up the victory and build a 2-1 series advantage for Chicago. It was one of four complete games thrown against the Angels in the series by the White Sox, who advanced and ultimately won the World Series.

It will be Garland's first appearance against his former team.

"Garland's going to be Garland. He's going step it up a notch," said White Sox manager Ozzie Guillen. "Obviously, he wants to beat his [former] teammates. It's a challenge for him and a challenge for us."

The Angels were treated to the return of staff ace John Lackey on Wednesday night, and they lead the American League in victories by the starting rotation. In manager Mike Scioscia's view, Garland, like all of his starters, will play the role of ace Thursday.

"These guys have been the lead dogs. They all have had that experience and they all have that potential," Scioscia said. "That is how much confidence we have and how much confidence they have."

Garland has allowed one run over his last 16 innings after giving up 11 runs over his previous 12 innings.
