ANAHEIM -- In an on-field ceremony prior to Thursday's Tigers-Angels game, Major League Baseball's Baseball Tomorrow Fund presented the Boys & Girls Club Orange County Alliance with a grant of $44,920 to support the growth of five new youth baseball programs in Orange County.

The grant will support the Boys & Girls Club Orange County Alliance (OCA), which manages the "Gene Autry Reviving Baseball in Inner Cities" (RBI) program, as it founds the programs, which are expected to benefit more than 500 youths between the ages of 12 and 18.

"The Boys & Girls Club Orange County Alliance manages about 16 Boys & Girls Clubs and serves about 87,000 members," BTF grant coordinator Tina Tamayoshi said. "We receive so many applications throughout the year, and it really is based on the need that the commitment of the organization, whether it's well established and how many youth will be impacted."

Tamayoshi was on hand on Thursday night to present the check to Nathan Chappell, president of the OCA advisory board, Christine Steele, OCA director, David Smith, Gene Autry RBI manager and Matt Bennett, Angels community affairs manager.

It's a logical fit, as the Boys & Girls Club is the official charity of MLB and the RBI program is an initiative of MLB. In 1999, MLB and the MLB Players' Association combined to donate $10 million to start the BTF.

"The average number of grants per year is about 29," Tamayoshi said. "To date, we've awarded more than $8.5 million."

So far, over $600,000 has been donated to youth baseball organizations in California. BTF's stated goal is to provide flexible funding for equipment and uniform purchases and capital improvements for youth baseball and softball programs.

The grant will help the OCA expand the scope of its Gene Autry RBI leagues, serving hundreds of additional youths for years to come.
