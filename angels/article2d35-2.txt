ARLINGTON -- Jered Weaver has faced the Rangers once this season, and what a start it was.

In his second start of the season, Weaver shut the Rangers out over seven innings, striking out six and allowing just three hits. As well as his strategy worked in that outing, Weaver might tinker with his approach this time out.

"Obviously, if you do well, you're going to try not to change it up too much," Weaver said. "I'll go back and check the tape, see what worked for me and what didn't and go from there."

Part of what worked for Weaver that outing may have been the fact he was pitching at home.

Weaver's first meeting with the Rangers came at Angel Stadium of Anaheim, where he boasts a 3.57 ERA. However, on the road, his ERA is more than a run higher, at 4.85. That figure could jump even higher with the combination of hitter-friendly Rangers Ballpark in Arlington and the offense Weaver will be facing.

The Rangers' five-run fifth inning Monday, in which they hit two home runs to turn an 8-1 rout into an 8-6 ballgame, wasn't lost on Weaver.

"No lead is safe in this park," Weaver said. "Any team can come back at any time with the home run ball, so you can't get too comfortable. I just have to focus on keeping the ball down and making my pitches to avoid the big inning, because all it takes is one inning for things to get away from you."

Weaver's start will come two years and a day after he earned his sixth straight victory to begin his Major League career.


Pitching matchup
LAA: RHP Jered Weaver (8-8, 4.17 ERA)
Weaver had great stuff for his third straight outing as he pitched seven scoreless innings before allowing two runs in the eighth. Weaver allowed just six hits, two coming in the eighth inning, in 7 1/3 innings and struck out six. The right-hander has now allowed just three earned runs and 10 hits in his previous three starts. Weaver is 2-1 with a 2.36 ERA in seven career starts against the Rangers.


TEX: Michael Ballard (8-3, 3.97 ERA for Double-A Frisco)
Ballard is expected to be called up and make his Major League debut against the first-place Angels. He is 8-3 with a 3.97 ERA in 15 starts at Double-A Frisco. He is 5-0 with a 2.17 ERA in his last seven starts. Ballard, 24, was the Rangers' 14th-round Draft pick out of the University of Virginia in the 2006 First-Year Player Draft. He was 14-7 with a 4.50 ERA in Class A last year.

Tidbits
Although Casey Kotchman wasn't in the starting lineup Tuesday with a left-hander on the mound for Texas, manager Mike Scioscia said he held Kotchman out of the lineup just to give him a day off. He said he's confident in the left-handed-hitting Kotchman's ability to handle left-handers. Tuesday was the Angels' first loss at Rangers Ballpark in Arlington all season. ... Joe Saunders' complete game was the first of his career, and was his 12th quality start of the season, which ties him for the team lead. He has received a total of seven runs of support in his last three starts. ... Garret Anderson has hit safely in eight of his last nine games. ... Vladimir Guerrero has hit safely in 70 of 78 career games against the Rangers. ... The Angels are now 16-21 in games where they have scored three runs or fewer, which is the best mark in the Majors.
