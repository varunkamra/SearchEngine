The Angels had been on a roll heading into their trip to Chicago, winning four in a row before the White Sox snapped grabbed a 5-4 loss at U.S. Cellular Field on Monday.
Game 2 of the three-game set will feature John Lackey taking the mound for the Angels. Lackey is 2-2 in six career starts against the White Sox, but won his first start against the South Siders last week. He allowed only two earned runs in seven innings.
Lackey will be facing off against Freddy Garcia, who will be making his 11th start of the year. Garcia has won his last two starts, allowing only two runs on 12 hits with an ERA of 1.20.
