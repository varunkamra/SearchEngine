KANSAS CITY -- In what he believes is a natural reaction to offseason surgery on his right ulnar nerve, Dustin Moseley has been experiencing some discomfort in the area of the elbow.

Placed on the 15-day disabled list on Sunday, Moseley will use the time to let the elbow calm down, he said, before returning to his middle relief role in the wake of five April starts.

John Lackey (strained right triceps) is on schedule for a return to the rotation around May 14, with a camp game set for Friday in Tempe, Ariz., in what should be his final tuneup after a four-inning, 68-pitch effort for Class A Rancho Cucamonga on Sunday.

"There's something going on," Moseley said of the elbow. "Any time your body gets cut on, it's going to protect that area. It's been on and off. It's been tough to get on top of the baseball sometimes."

Thrust into the fifth starter's role with Lackey and Kelvim Escobar (torn right labrum) sidelined, Moseley is 1-3 with a 7.85 ERA in seven appearances, the last two in relief.

"I've got to get back on track with things," Moseley said. "After talking with [the medical staff], we decided it would be best to take a couple days off [and] try to get my arm slot back where it needs to be."

Angels manager Mike Scioscia felt Moseley's inability to repeat pitches led to his problems in several of his starts. His stuff (21 strikeouts in 28 2/3 innings) has been solid, but the right-hander hasn't been as consistent with his delivery as he needs to be.

"It's just muscle," Moseley said of the recurring pain, "around and behind the elbow. I felt it would go away. I'll work through it."
