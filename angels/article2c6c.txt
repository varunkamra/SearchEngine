TEMPE, Ariz. -- Jered Weaver, taking it more slowly this spring than last year when he came out of the chute blazing, threw off a mound for the first time on Friday and was feeling good afterward.

"I threw 25 fastballs," the Angels right-hander told MLB.com, "and everything felt good."










Weaver has made 200 innings his goal this season after falling short by 23 1/3 innings last year. He has had periodic right shoulder issues, so the slower pace this spring was precautionary more than anything after a relatively light offseason of playing catch and eating heavily to beef up to 210 pounds for endurance purposes.

"I want to be ready when it counts," Weaver said, adding that he's "not interested in being the Cactus League pitcher of the year."

Weaver had been throwing long toss, moving out to 200 feet before finally giving his arm a stress test on the mound.

After his dynamic rookie year, going 11-2 with a 2.56 ERA, he develop shoulder issues in camp in 2007 and got a late start. Hoping to avoid that, he worked harder after the '07 season and got in peak form during the spring, but had a 4.90 ERA in 11 second-half starts after taking a 4.03 ERA to the All-Star break in 19 outings.

Weaver is determined to be more economical this season with early-count outs, helping him get deeper in games.

"I'll be trying to get outs in my first three pitches," he said. "I want to be efficient early in counts."

Weaver averaged 5.9 innings in his 30 starts in 2008 and would like to improve that substantially. He'd also like to lift his win total, after going 11-10 with a 4.33 ERA.

"I'm still a work in progress," he said. "I want to get better, and smarter, every year."
