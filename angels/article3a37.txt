TEMPE, Ariz. -- Francisco Rodriguez checked into the Angels' camp Friday, eight days behind the other pitchers, and will be leaving early to join the Venezuela team next week for the World Baseball Classic.

After taking a morning physical, the Angels wasted no time in getting Rodriguez, who saved 45 games last season, on the mound. He threw all of his pitches in an eight-minute bullpen session, threw long toss and participated in fielding practice.

"As far as conditioning, I feel great," Rodriguez said. "I had some issues with my visa, but I was doing everything I could. I was running and doing everything so when I got back here, I'd be fine.

"It was a very unfortunate situation with the visa. It was something I could not control. It was a tough time getting the visa. What can I do? I've got to start over again, catch up with those guys, try to do my routine, and make sure I'll be ready for the season."

Rodriguez said he had not thrown off a mound since Feb. 6, for Venezuela in the Caribbean Series championship.

"You really can't accelerate him or you'll risk setting him back," Angels manager Mike Scioscia said. "You just get him caught up. He'll get on pace. He'll get where he needs to be."

Scioscia was glad to have Rodriguez in camp, but was not pleased that he was late.

"We set these report dates to make sure we have enough time to get everybody ready, to where they need to be," Scioscia said. "When somebody is late, there is obviously some catching up to do. We knew he'd be here sometime. Unfortunately the visa problems got him here a little bit later than the other guys, but we have enough time to get him caught up."



Rodriguez will not be in the Angels' camp long, joining the Venezuelan club on Thursday in Clearwater, Fla., to practice for the World Baseball Classic.

"For me, it will be an honor to wear a Venezuelan shirt," he said.

Rodriguez is not supposed to pitch more than one inning in any game, and won't throw on back-to-back days for Venezuela.

Rodriguez moved into the closer's role for the first time last season after serving as the primary setup man for Troy Percival the previous two years.

"The pressure is going to be there, no matter what," Rodriguez said of closing. "I've got to be more focused on what I'm doing, concentrate, learn more about the hitters, learn more about situations. Those little details are going to make me a better pitcher.

"I've got to learn from mistakes last year and try not to do them this year. The little stuff, like walking guys. I've got to get ahead in the count. All the little details that caused me trouble last year in blown saves, I'll try to reduce that. I've just got to stay healthy and repeat the year I had last year."

Rodriguez, a 24-year-old right-hander, said the bullpen should be stronger with the addition of veteran Hector Carrasco and left-hander J.C. Romero.

"J.C. takes pressure off myself and [Scot] Shields," Rodriguez said. "The other team has got to think about that we got a pretty good lefty out there in late innings when they have to make their moves."

Rodriguez has been successful with an overpowering fastball and an excellent breaking ball. He used a changeup in the Minors, but seldom needs a third pitch as a one-inning closer.

"You don't experiment with a changeup against Alex Rodriguez in the ninth inning at Yankee Stadium," pitching coach Bud Black said.

Said Rodriguez: "A changeup is something I don't need really, but it is something that is going to help me in the future. Right now, we're going to be focused on just being ready. As far as a changeup, I don't want to do something different to disturb my mechanics or my other pitches."

Black has no trepidations about Rodriguez being ready when the season starts.

"We want to make sure when we send him out, that he's in condition to pitch again," Black said. "With the resiliency of his arm, his athleticism and his youth, it doesn't take long for a young guy to get in shape. Essentially, he's not really behind arm-wise because he pitched roughly 2 1/2 to three weeks ago in the Caribbean finals. He got game innings. I suspect his arm is fine."
