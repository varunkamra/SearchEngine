ANAHEIM -- The number of members in the Angels Hall of Fame will grow to eight on Thursday when Chuck Finley and Brian Downing are inducted in a ceremony before the Angels play the A's at Angel Stadium.

Finley and Downing will join the elite company of Nolan Ryan, Rod Carew, Bobby Grich, Don Baylor, Jim Fregosi and Jimmie Reese in the Hall.

Finley, who played with the Angels from 1986-99, holds the club's all-time record in wins (165), innings pitched (2,575) and starts (379). The left-hander was also a four-time All-Star with the Angels and won more than 15 games six times.

Downing played for the Angels for 13 seasons from 1978-90 and left the club as the franchise leader in games (1,661), at-bats (5,854), runs (889), hits (1,588), total bases (2,580), doubles (282), home runs (222) and RBIs (846). The catcher-turned-outfielder hit at least 20 home runs in six of seven seasons from 1982-88.
